## ABSOLUTE RULE: Core Rules & Compendium Are Word of God

The Core Rules and Compendium PDFs at `docs/rules/` are the canonical authority for ALL game mechanics. When routing data tasks, ensure agents verify values against the PDFs, not just code. Any agent can extract data using `py -c "import fitz; ..."`.

---

## Critical Gotchas — Must Remember

### 1. Three-Enum Sync Rule

Any enum change MUST be routed exclusively to character-data-engineer. Three files must stay in perfect alignment:
- `src/core/systems/GlobalEnums.gd` (autoload)
- `src/core/enums/GameEnums.gd` (class_name)
- `src/game/campaign/crew/FiveParsecsGameEnums.gd` (CharacterClass)

Never let another agent modify enums independently.

### 2. Agent Dependency Order

When decomposing multi-domain tasks, route in this order:
```
data (character-data-engineer)
  → campaign (campaign-systems-engineer)
    → battle (battle-systems-engineer)
      → bug-hunt (bug-hunt-specialist)
        → UI (ui-panel-developer)
          → QA (qa-specialist)
```

### 3. Cross-Mode Review Required

Changes to shared files MUST get bug-hunt-specialist review:
- `TacticalBattleUI.gd` — shared between Standard and Bug Hunt
- `GameState.gd` — handles both campaign types
- `SceneRouter.gd` — routes to both mode UIs

### 4. FiveParsecsCampaignCore is Resource

`campaign["key"] = val` **silently fails**. Use `progress_data["key"]` for runtime state.
Route bugs about "lost state" or "data not persisting" to campaign-systems-engineer — this is usually the root cause.

### 5. Godot 4.6 Type Inference

`var x := dict["key"]` will NOT compile — Dictionary values are always Variant.
This is the root cause of "Cannot infer the type" errors project-wide. Always use explicit type annotation: `var x: Type = dict["key"]`.

## PDF Rulebooks & Python Extraction Tools

All agents can now extract data directly from source PDFs — route data verification tasks accordingly:
- **Core Rules PDF**: `docs/rules/pdfcoffee_com_muh052042_five_parsecs_from_home_3e_rulebook_2021.pdf`
- **Compendium PDF**: `docs/rules/Five Parsecs From Home-Compendium.pdf`
- **Text extractions**: `docs/rules/core_rulebook.txt` and `docs/rules/compendium_source.txt`
- **Python**: `py` launcher (NOT `python`), PyMuPDF 1.27.1 (fitz) installed
- **Example**: `py -c "import fitz; doc = fitz.open('path'); print(doc[PAGE].get_text())"`

---

## QA Documentation Suite (Mar 20, 2026)

Route all QA-related questions through the qa-specialist agent, which now has 4 master docs:

- `docs/QA_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md` — Start here for overall QA health, open bugs, next priorities
- `docs/QA_CORE_RULES_TEST_PLAN.md` — 170 mechanics → test status (47 NOT_TESTED, 63 MCP_VALIDATED, 0 RULES_VERIFIED)
- `docs/QA_INTEGRATION_SCENARIOS.md` — 9 E2E workflow scripts with MCP templates
- `docs/QA_UX_UI_TEST_PLAN.md` — Systematic UI testing (theme, responsive, TweenFX, accessibility)

After any sprint that fixes bugs or adds features, remind the assigned agent to update the dashboard and core rules plan.

## Project Status (Mar 21, 2026)

- **0 open bugs** — First time at zero. 4 deferred items remain (architectural).
- **Phase 33 runtime-validated**: PostBattlePhase (19/19 signals), WorldPhaseComponent (9/9), 3 runtime fixes applied
- **5-turn MCP playthrough PASS**: Turns 3-5, all counters consistent, 0 crashes, event bus cleanup working
- **~99 uncommitted files** — Phase 33 optimization + QA bug fixes + runtime fixes. Needs commit.
- **Next priorities**: Commit, 47 NOT_TESTED mechanics (focus: Compendium DLC), RULES_VERIFIED pass, character type shadowing fix

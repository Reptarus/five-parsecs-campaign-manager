## Critical Gotchas — Must Remember

### 1. Three-Enum Sync Rule

Any enum change MUST touch all three files simultaneously:
- `src/core/systems/GlobalEnums.gd` (autoload)
- `src/core/enums/GameEnums.gd` (class_name)
- `src/game/campaign/crew/FiveParsecsGameEnums.gd` (CharacterClass)

Values and ordering must match across all three. Misalignment causes wrong enum-to-int mapping and silent data corruption.

### 2. Flat Stats — No Sub-Object

Characters use flat properties directly. There is NO `stats` sub-object:
```gdscript
# CORRECT
character.combat = 3
character.reactions = 2

# WRONG — CharacterStats.gd exists but is NOT used as a property
character.stats.combat = 3  # Does not exist
```

Stats: `combat`, `reactions`, `toughness`, `savvy`, `tech`, `move`, `speed`, `luck`

### 3. Equipment Key is "equipment"

Ship stash: `campaign.equipment_data["equipment"]` — **NOT** `"pool"`.
Using `"pool"` was a systemic bug fixed in Phase 22.

### 4. Dual-Key Aliases

`Character.to_dictionary()` returns BOTH:
- `"id"` AND `"character_id"` (must be identical)
- `"name"` AND `"character_name"` (must be identical)

Always include both aliases when creating character dicts manually (tests, factories).

### 5. Godot 4.6 Type Inference

`var x := dict["key"]` will NOT compile — Dictionary values are always Variant.
Always use explicit type annotation: `var x: Type = dict["key"]`. Zero exceptions.
Same applies to untyped Array access and any method returning Variant.

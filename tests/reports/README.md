# Test Reports Directory

This directory contains automated test run reports generated by the test runner. Each report provides detailed information about test execution, including:

## Report Contents
- Test execution summary (total, passed, failed, errors, pending)
- Performance metrics (duration, average test time, peak memory)
- List of test failures
- List of errors encountered
- Performance issues identified
- Recommendations for improvements

## File Naming
Reports are automatically named using the format: `test_run_[timestamp].md`

## Usage
Reports are generated automatically when running tests through:
1. The test runner script (`tests/run_tests.gd`)
2. The GUT plugin in the Godot editor
3. CI/CD pipelines

## Report Analysis
Use these reports to:
- Track test suite health over time
- Identify problematic or flaky tests
- Monitor performance regressions
- Guide test suite improvements

## Retention Policy
- Reports are generated per test run
- Old reports can be safely deleted
- Consider keeping reports from significant milestones for historical reference

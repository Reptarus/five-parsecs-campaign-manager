# UI Components Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed the UIManager Class
- Implemented `UIManager` as a proper Node-based class
- Added options menu support with `show_options()` and `hide_options()` methods
- Properly connected to the options menu signals

### 2. Implemented GameplayOptionsMenu
- Created a proper `gameplay_options_menu.gd` that extends Control
- Implemented settings management with appropriate signals
- Added UI update mechanisms and game state integration
- Created `gameplay_options.tscn` with the correct Control layout

### 3. Added Game Enums
- Created `GameEnums.gd` class with necessary game enumerations 
- Implemented `DifficultyLevel` enum for difficulty settings
- Added utility methods for enum handling

### 4. Updated Test Files
- Fixed `test_ui_manager.gd` tests to work with the new Node-based UIManager
- Updated `test_mobile_ui.gd` with a MockOptionsMenu class for testing
- Enabled previously disabled tests now that implementation is complete

## Components Created/Modified

1. **UIManager (src/ui/screens/UIManager.gd)**
   - Added options menu interaction methods
   - Added menu state tracking
   - Added connection method for options menu

2. **GameplayOptionsMenu (src/ui/screens/gameplay_options_menu.gd)**
   - UI component interaction
   - Settings management
   - Game state integration
   - Signal handling

3. **GameEnums (src/core/enums/GameEnums.gd)**
   - Centralized game enumerations
   - Support for UI settings

4. **GameplayOptions Scene (src/ui/screens/gameplay_options.tscn)**
   - Complete UI layout for options
   - Connected to the options menu script

## Testing

The implementation allows for proper testing of:
- Options menu visibility state
- UI Manager integration
- Signal connections (like back button handling)
- Performance metrics

## Error Resolution

The original error occurred because:
1. The test was trying to assign a Control-based script (gameplay_options_menu.gd) to a Node object
2. The UIManager was trying to call methods on an unimplemented options menu

These issues have been fixed by properly implementing all required components and updating the tests to use the new implementations.

## Next Steps

1. Register the `UIManagerRegistry` as an autoload for global access
2. Update any remaining UI controllers that might reference the old style
3. Connect the new options menu to main game screens
4. Update any missing enums or game features that the options menu might need

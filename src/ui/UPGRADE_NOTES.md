# UI System Upgrade Notes for Godot 4.4

This document outlines the UI system enhancements implemented for the Five Parsecs Campaign Manager as part of the upgrade to Godot 4.4.

## Overview of Changes

The UI system has been significantly enhanced to leverage Godot 4.4's improved capabilities, with a focus on:

1. **Theme Management**: Centralized theme handling with multiple variants
2. **Responsive Design**: Better adaptation to different screen sizes
3. **Accessibility**: Improved support for users with different needs
4. **Performance**: More efficient UI updates and resource usage

## New Components

### ThemeManager

A new centralized theme manager (`src/ui/themes/ThemeManager.gd`) has been implemented that provides:

- Multiple theme variants (Default, Dark, Light, High Contrast)
- Dynamic theme switching at runtime
- UI scaling capabilities
- Accessibility features (high contrast mode, reduced animations)
- Theme property overrides for runtime customization

### SettingsDialog

A new settings dialog (`src/ui/dialogs/SettingsDialog.gd`) allows users to:

- Select their preferred theme
- Adjust UI scaling
- Toggle accessibility features
- Apply settings immediately or reset to defaults

### ResponsiveContainer

A new responsive container (`src/ui/components/ResponsiveContainer.gd`) provides:

- Automatic layout switching between horizontal and vertical based on available space
- Scale-aware spacing and padding
- Integration with the UI manager for coordinated updates

## Enhanced Existing Components

### UIManager

The UI Manager (`src/ui/screens/UIManager.gd`) has been enhanced with:

- Integration with the ThemeManager
- Support for responsive UI elements
- Batched UI updates for better performance
- Improved dialog management
- Better screen transition handling

## Theme Resources

New theme resources have been created:

- `src/ui/themes/base_theme.tres`: Base theme with common properties
- `src/ui/themes/dark_theme.tres`: Dark theme variant
- `src/ui/themes/light_theme.tres`: Light theme variant
- `src/ui/themes/high_contrast_theme.tres`: High contrast theme for accessibility

## Implementation Details

### Type Annotations

All new and modified code uses Godot 4.4's enhanced type annotations for better code completion, error checking, and documentation:

```gdscript
signal theme_changed(theme: Theme)
signal scale_changed(scale_factor: float)

var current_theme: Theme
var scale_factor: float = 1.0
```

### Signal Connections

Signal connections use the new typed callable syntax:

```gdscript
theme_manager.theme_changed.connect(_on_theme_changed)
responsive_container.layout_changed.connect(_on_layout_changed)
```

### Resource Loading

Theme resources are loaded using Godot 4.4's improved resource handling:

```gdscript
var theme = load("res://src/ui/themes/dark_theme.tres")
```

## Migration Guide

### Updating Existing UI Components

To update existing UI components to work with the new theme system:

1. Replace direct theme property access with ThemeManager calls:

   ```gdscript
   # Old approach
   var color = get_theme_color("font_color", "Button")
   
   # New approach
   var theme_manager = get_node("/root/ThemeManager")
   var color = theme_manager.get_color(ThemeManager.ThemeColor.PRIMARY)
   ```

2. Register responsive elements with the UI Manager:

   ```gdscript
   # In _ready()
   var ui_manager = get_node("/root/UIManager")
   ui_manager.register_responsive_element(self)
   ```

3. Use the ResponsiveContainer for layouts that need to adapt to different screen sizes:

   ```gdscript
   var container = ResponsiveContainer.new()
   container.min_width_for_horizontal = 800
   add_child(container)
   ```

### Testing UI Components

When testing UI components with the new system:

1. Verify appearance in all theme variants
2. Test at different scale factors
3. Ensure accessibility features work correctly
4. Check responsive behavior at different screen sizes

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Custom controls may need additional work to fully support all theme variants
- Some older UI components still need to be updated to use the new theme system
- Mobile-specific UI adjustments may be needed for optimal touch interaction

## Future Improvements

Planned future improvements include:

- Custom theme editor for in-game theme customization
- Additional accessibility features (text-to-speech, keyboard navigation improvements)
- More responsive container types for complex layouts
- Performance optimizations for very large UI hierarchies

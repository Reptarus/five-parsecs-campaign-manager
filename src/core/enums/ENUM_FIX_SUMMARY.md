# Enum System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed GameStateManager Enum References
- Updated GameStateManager to use the new centralized GameEnums class
- Changed the import path from `src/core/systems/GlobalEnums.gd` to `src/core/enums/GameEnums.gd`
- Replaced strongly typed enum references with basic int types to prevent type conflicts
- Added missing settings-related variables and methods to GameStateManager

### 2. Enhanced GameEnums Class
- Added missing `FiveParcsecsCampaignPhase` enum 
- Added `GameState` enum to replace the previous enum from GlobalEnums
- Maintained consistent structure and documentation

### 3. Updated GameplayOptionsMenu
- Changed references from `GameEnumsClass` to `GameEnums`
- Updated method calls to match GameStateManager's new setter pattern:
  - `set_tutorials_enabled()` instead of direct property access
  - `set_auto_save_enabled()` instead of direct property access

## Implementation Details

### GameStateManager Changes
1. Changed the import path for GameEnums
2. Removed typed enum parameters in signals and replaced with int
3. Changed variable types from specific enums to int for better compatibility
4. Added settings properties with proper defaults
5. Added setter methods for the settings
6. Added save/load settings stub methods

### GameEnums Changes
1. Added `FiveParcsecsCampaignPhase` enum with all necessary states
2. Added `GameState` enum to replace the missing enum
3. Maintained consistent documentation format 

### GameplayOptionsMenu Changes
1. Changed constant reference to match new path
2. Updated method calls to match new setter methods in GameStateManager

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Type Safety**: While we're using int instead of specific enum types in the signals and function parameters, the actual enum values are still used, maintaining type safety where it matters.

2. **Consistency**: All game enums are now in a single file, making maintenance easier.

3. **Clean API**: GameStateManager now has proper setter methods for all properties, following a consistent pattern.

4. **Backwards Compatibility**: The changes maintain compatibility with existing code by preserving the same enum values.

## Next Steps

1. Update any other scripts that might be using the old GlobalEnums path
2. Ensure the autoload for GameStateManager is properly set up
3. Consider adding signals for the new settings properties
4. Implement the save/load settings methods to persist user preferences

## Implementation Notes

### Core Rules Integration
1. **Campaign Turn Sequence**: Follow the exact flow from p.78-100 of core_rules.md
   - Travel Steps (ship movement)
   - New World Arrival (world generation)
   - World Steps (story events, missions, trading)

2. **Character System**: Implement according to p.26-41
   - Start with the crew creation process
   - Follow the exact stat blocks and mechanics

3. **Battle Results**: Focus on recording results rather than simulation
   - Players will handle the physical battle on the table
   - App should focus on setup and outcome recording

4. **Rulebook Accuracy**: For each system, directly reference the corresponding rulebook pages
   - Copy exact tables and algorithms where possible
   - Match the exact terminology used in the rulebook
   - When in doubt, prioritize rulebook accuracy over implementation convenience

### Data Utilization Strategy
1. Use the extensive JSON data files in the `/data` directory as primary sources:
   - `character_creation_data.json` for character generation
   - `mission_templates.json` for mission creation
   - `planet_types.json` and `location_types.json` for world generation
   - `weapons.json` and `armor.json` for equipment

2. Create data loaders for each major system that:
   - Load and validate data at startup
   - Provide efficient access methods
   - Include error handling for missing or corrupt data

### UI Standards (Updated)
1. **File Organization**:
   - **Screens**: All UI screens should be placed in `src/ui/screens/` and organized by feature
   - **Components**: Reusable UI components should be placed in `src/ui/components/`
   - **Resources**: UI resources (themes, styles, etc.) should be placed in `src/ui/resource/`

2. **Component Design**:
   - Components should have clear separation of concerns
   - Components should be designed for reusability
   - Complex screens should be composed of smaller components

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use the standardized ResponsiveContainer for responsive layouts
   - Design UI for multiple screen sizes and orientations

4. **Documentation**:
   - Each directory should have a README.md file
   - Each component should have clear usage examples
   - Document the purpose and integration points for complex UI screens

### Script Architecture Lessons Learned
1. **Class Name Management**:
   - Avoid using `class_name` for scripts that might be referenced in multiple places
   - Use explicit preload/load references with absolute paths
   - Document global script classes in a central registry

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Create clear dependency hierarchies to avoid circular references
   - Use load() instead of preload() when dealing with potential circular dependencies
   - Consider using dependency injection for complex systems

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - Implement progressive validation during development
   - Add runtime checks for critical dependencies
   - Create diagnostic tools for identifying reference issues

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Maintain clear separation between base classes and implementations
   - Use consistent naming conventions across the project
   - Organize scripts by functionality rather than inheritance

5. **Cache Error Prevention**:
   - Avoid using nested inner classes in scripts, especially when they're instantiated frequently
   - Use dictionary-based factory functions instead of class constructors (examples in ActionPanel.gd, EventLog.gd)
   - When refactoring existing code with cache errors:
     - Replace classes with static factory functions that return dictionaries
     - Add helper functions for common operations that would have been class methods
     - Structure object interfaces to be explicit about available properties
   - In test files:
     - Use absolute paths in extends statements (e.g., extends "res://tests/fixtures/specialized/battle_test.gd")
     - Be careful with track_test_resource() when using dictionaries instead of Resources
     - Create specific test utility methods that work with dictionary-based data objects

- **âœ“ Injury Tables** - Added detailed injury tables with proper outcomes and recovery times
- **âœ“ Loot Generation** - Updated to use the appropriate loot tables from rulebook
- **âœ“ Rival System** - Added proper rival generation mechanics per rulebook

## Test Suite Stabilization

### Current Status

The test suite has been undergoing significant stabilization efforts, with a focus on resolving critical issues that were causing test failures and inconsistent results.

### Completed Fixes

- **Enemy Test Integration**: Successfully fixed and stabilized all three primary enemy test files:
  - `test_enemy_integration.gd`
  - `test_enemy_campaign_flow.gd`
  - `test_enemy_group_tactics.gd`

- **Callable Assignment Issues**: Resolved issues with improper callable assignments to Resource objects by:
  - Replacing direct lambda assignments with proper GDScript source code implementation
  - Using `GDScript.new()` with `source_code` to define methods properly
  - Implementing type-safe property access patterns

- **Unicode NULL Character Issues**: Eliminated Unicode NULL character problems in test files by:
  - Rewriting all lambda functions as proper GDScript methods
  - Moving method implementations inside string-based script definitions
  - Ensuring proper signal definitions in the scripts

- **Resource Tracking**: Improved resource tracking and cleanup in test fixtures:
  - Proper use of `track_test_resource()` for all created resources
  - Appropriate cleanup in `after_each()` methods
  - Type-safe node creation and management

### Documentation Updates

- Created new `test_callable_patterns.md` document with detailed examples of proper method mocking
- Updated test migration documentation with guidance on fixing callable issues
- Added examples of proper enemy test implementation

### Next Steps

- Complete verification of all integration tests to ensure they run without errors
- Apply the same patterns to remaining test files with similar issues
- Update test templates to include the new safe patterns
- Implement automated checks to prevent reintroduction of these issues

### Metrics

- **Fixed Test Files**: 3 of ~20 priority files (15%)
- **Test Success Rate**: Improved from ~60% to ~75%
- **Linter Errors**: Reduced by approximately 30%

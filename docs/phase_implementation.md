  - Recovery mechanisms

## Phase Transition Flow
1. Phase validation before transition
2. State capture for rollback
3. Error handling during transition
4. Recovery attempt if validation fails
5. State persistence after successful transition
6. Auto-save on critical phases

## Integration Points
- **ValidationManager**: Handles state validation for all phases
- **ErrorLogger**: Manages error tracking and reporting
- **SaveManager**: Handles state persistence and recovery
- **GameState**: Manages global game state
- **CampaignPhaseManager**: Controls phase transitions and recovery

## Error Handling and Recovery
- Comprehensive validation before phase transitions
- Automatic recovery attempts for failed states
- Manual recovery options for critical failures
- State rollback capabilities
- Detailed error logging and tracking
- Performance impact monitoring

## Current Development Focus
- Implementing comprehensive error recovery
- Enhancing validation coverage
- Adding performance monitoring
- Improving user feedback for errors
- Testing recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps
1. Complete error recovery implementation
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Enhance error reporting UI
5. Document recovery procedures

## Technical Debt
- Need improved error reporting UI
- Require comprehensive testing framework
- Documentation updates needed for recovery procedures
- Performance optimization for validation checks
- Error handling for edge cases

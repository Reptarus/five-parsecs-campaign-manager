# Five Parsecs Campaign Manager - Morning Gameplan

## Current Progress Summary

### Phase 1: Configuration Update & Infrastructure
- ✅ Modified GUT configuration to use correct test file pattern
- ✅ Added `tests/unit/ui/themes` for ThemeManager tests
- ✅ Created test templates for new components (ThemeManager, SettingsDialog, ResponsiveContainer, UIManager)

## Tomorrow Morning Priorities

### 1. Complete Phase 1: Create Missing Test Directories (First 30-45 minutes)
- [ ] Map out the `src` directory structure (especially `src/ui`) and mirror it in `tests/unit`
- [ ] Create any missing test directories that should mirror the source code
- [ ] Verify folder structure matches between `src` and `tests` directories

### 2. Begin Phase 2: Critical Component Tests (Next 1-2 hours)
- [ ] Create tests for theme resources:
  - [ ] Implement tests for `base_theme.tres`
  - [ ] Implement tests for `dark_theme.tres` 
  - [ ] Create test helpers for theme verification

### 3. Update Base Test Classes (If time permits)
- [ ] Add theme awareness to `component_test_base.gd`
- [ ] Implement utility methods for theme testing

## Reference Implementation Details

### Test Structure Template
```gdscript
extends GutTest

# Dependencies
var ThemeManager = load("res://src/ui/themes/theme_manager.gd")
var theme_manager: ThemeManager

func before_each():
    theme_manager = ThemeManager.new()
    add_child_autoqfree(theme_manager)

func after_each():
    # Cleanup

func test_component_initialization():
    # Test initial state

func test_theme_connection():
    # Test theme manager connections

func test_theme_switching():
    # Test theme change response
```

### Theme Testing Focus Areas
1. Component connects to theme manager correctly
2. Component responds appropriately to theme changes
3. Component adapts to UI scaling
4. Component handles accessibility features properly

## Next Steps After Tomorrow
- Complete remaining Phase 2 tasks (UI Component Tests)
- Begin Phase 3: Integration Testing
- Prepare for full test suite execution in Phase 4

## Notes
- Remember to check the Godot 4.4 documentation for any new testing features
- Focus on testing components that directly use the theme system first
- Refer to the implementation details in the project plan for consistent test patterns

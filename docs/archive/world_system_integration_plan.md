# World System Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating and optimizing the world and location systems in the Five Parsecs Campaign Manager. The goal is to consolidate the existing systems into a more cohesive, JSON-based framework that aligns with the rest of the application.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Core Classes

#### GameWorldTrait
- Created a standardized `GameWorldTrait` class to handle world traits
- Implemented serialization and deserialization methods
- Added methods for retrieving modifiers and checking tags
- Ensured compatibility with the JSON data format

#### GameLocation
- Refactored the `GameLocation` class to use the new framework
- Added resource management functionality
- Implemented market system with dynamic pricing
- Added methods for managing connected locations, missions, and points of interest
- Ensured proper serialization and deserialization

#### GamePlanet
- Refactored the `GamePlanet` class to use the new framework
- Added support for multiple locations per planet
- Implemented resource and threat management
- Added methods for managing world traits and their effects
- Ensured proper serialization and deserialization

#### GameWorldManager
- Created a comprehensive `GameWorldManager` class to handle world generation and management
- Implemented methods for generating sectors, planets, and locations
- Added functionality for connecting locations and planets
- Implemented serialization and deserialization for game state persistence

### 2. Variable Naming Fixes

- Renamed `trait` variables to `world_trait` or `current_trait` to avoid conflicts with the keyword used in core rules
- Updated all related methods to use the new variable names
- Fixed linter errors related to variable naming

### 3. Serialization Standardization

- Standardized serialization methods across all classes
- Renamed `to_dict()` to `serialize()` in the `GameWorldTrait` class for consistency
- Added a backward compatibility method to ensure existing code continues to work
- Implemented static `deserialize()` methods for all classes

## Next Steps

### 1. Data Files

- Create JSON data files for world traits, location types, and planet types
- Ensure all data files follow a consistent format
- Add validation for data files to prevent runtime errors

### 2. UI Integration

- Update the world map UI to use the new `GameWorldManager`
- Create UI components for displaying planet and location details
- Implement UI for managing resources, threats, and world traits

### 3. Game Logic Integration

- Connect the world system to the campaign management system
- Implement travel mechanics between locations and planets
- Add events and encounters based on world traits and location types
- Integrate with the mission generation system

### 4. Testing

- Create unit tests for all new classes
- Test serialization and deserialization to ensure data persistence
- Test world generation with various parameters
- Verify that all UI components display the correct information

### 5. Documentation

- Update the developer documentation with the new class structure
- Create user documentation for the world and location systems
- Document the JSON data format for modders

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete core classes and fix any remaining issues
2. **Week 2**: Create JSON data files and implement data loading
3. **Week 3**: Update UI components and integrate with game logic
4. **Week 4**: Testing and bug fixing
5. **Week 5**: Documentation and final polish

## Conclusion

The integration of the world and location systems into the JSON-based framework will provide a more cohesive and maintainable codebase. The standardized approach to serialization and deserialization will ensure data persistence, while the modular design will allow for easier expansion in the future.

By following this plan, we will create a robust world system that enhances the gameplay experience and provides a solid foundation for future development.

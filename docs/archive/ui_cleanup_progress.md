# UI Cleanup Progress

This document tracks the progress of the UI cleanup process for the Five Parsecs Campaign Manager.

## Completed Steps

### 1. Documentation and Planning

- ✅ Created `docs/ui_refactoring_guide.md` with comprehensive cleanup plan
- ✅ Created `docs/ui_duplicate_files.md` identifying duplicate files and resolution strategy
- ✅ Created initial README files for UI directories

### 2. File Organization

- ✅ Created organization scripts (`scripts/organize_ui_files.bat`)
- ✅ Created reference update tools (`scripts/find_ui_references.py` and `scripts/apply_ui_replacements.py`)
- ✅ Created cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup_original_ui_files.bat`)
- ✅ Executed file organization script
- ✅ Updated file references in code

### 3. Pending Steps

#### Phase 2: Standardize Component Implementation

- [ ] Consolidate duplicate ResponsiveContainer implementations
- [ ] Standardize phase panel components
- [ ] Implement consistent API patterns across UI components
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new component organization

#### Phase 3: Refine UI Architecture

- [ ] Implement centralized theme management
- [ ] Create reusable UI component library
- [ ] Document UI component usage patterns
- [ ] Establish style guide for future UI development

## Notes and Observations

During the cleanup process, we identified the following key observations:

1. The most common duplication was in UI components (`ResponsiveContainer` implementations)
2. The scene file references were well-maintained in most cases, requiring minimal updates
3. The new organization structure provides a clear separation between screens, components, and resources

## Next Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Verify the organization script ran successfully
2. ✅ Run the reference detection script and update references
3. [ ] Run the cleanup script to remove original files after verification
4. [ ] Begin consolidating duplicate ResponsiveContainer implementations
5. [ ] Update remaining documentation

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create directory structure documentation (`README.md` files)
- [x] Create file organization scripts (`organize_ui_files.bat` and `.sh`)
- [x] Document duplicate files (`ui_duplicate_files.md`)
- [x] Create reference detection script (`find_ui_references.py`)
- [x] Consolidate duplicate ResponsiveContainer implementations
  - Removed duplicate `src/ui/components/ResponsiveContainer.gd`
  - Removed duplicate `src/ui/components/CampaignResponsiveLayout.gd`
  - Standardized on base versions in `src/ui/components/base/`
  - Created test scenes for both components:
    - `src/ui/components/base/ResponsiveContainerTest.tscn`
    - `src/ui/components/base/CampaignResponsiveLayoutTest.tscn`

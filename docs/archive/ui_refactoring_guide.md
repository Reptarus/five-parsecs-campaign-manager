# UI Refactoring Guide

This guide documents the process of cleaning up and organizing the UI files for the Five Parsecs Campaign Manager.

## Current Issues

1. **Duplicated files and functionality:**
   - Duplicate `CampaignDashboard` files in `/src/ui/` and `/src/ui/screens/campaign/`
   - Duplicate `BasePhasePanel` files in different locations
   - Duplicate responsive container implementations

2. **Inconsistent structure and file placement:**
   - Some UI files are placed in the root `/src/ui/` directory, while similar files are organized in subdirectories
   - Phase panels appear in both `/src/ui/screens/` and `/src/ui/screens/campaign/phases/`

3. **Inconsistent naming conventions:**
   - Some files use PascalCase, while others use snake_case
   - Some panel names include "UI" suffix, others don't

4. **Missing proper organization:**
   - Character-related UI files spread across multiple directories
   - Multiple scripts with similar functionality in different locations

## Cleanup Steps

### Phase 1: Documentation and Organization (Completed)

1. ✅ Create README files for all UI directories
2. ✅ Document the structure and purpose of each UI component directory
3. ✅ Create batch scripts to organize files

### Phase 2: File Reorganization (Next)

1. Run the `organize_ui_files.bat` script to move files to their proper locations
2. Verify that the moved files work correctly
3. Remove the original files from the root directory
4. Update any references to the moved files

### Phase 3: Duplicate Resolution

1. **Responsive Containers:**
   - Keep only the versions in `components/base/`
   - Update all references to use the base components
   - Remove duplicate implementations

2. **Phase Panels:**
   - Use only the panels in `screens/campaign/phases/`
   - Remove duplicate implementations in `screens/`
   - Update references to use the correct paths

3. **CampaignDashboard:**
   - Standardize on the version in `screens/campaign/`
   - Remove the duplicate in the root directory
   - Update references to use the correct path

### Phase 4: Naming Standardization

1. Rename files to follow PascalCase for scene files and GDScript classes
2. Standardize panel naming (remove inconsistent "UI" suffixes)
3. Update all references to the renamed files

### Phase 5: Refactoring

1. Consolidate similar functionality
2. Enhance documentation with GDScript doc comments
3. Improve code organization and readability
4. Implement consistent error handling
5. Add validation for user inputs

## Implementation Details

### Responsive Container Refactoring

The duplicate responsive container implementations should be consolidated:

1. Keep: `src/ui/components/base/ResponsiveContainer.gd`
2. Remove: `src/ui/components/ResponsiveContainer.gd`

Same for `CampaignResponsiveLayout.gd`.

### BasePhasePanel Refactoring

1. Keep: `src/ui/screens/campaign/phases/BasePhasePanel.gd`
2. Remove: `src/ui/screens/BasePhasePanel.gd`

### Character UI Refactoring

All character UI components should be moved to appropriate directories:

1. Component pieces: `src/ui/components/character/`
2. Full screens: `src/ui/screens/character/`

## Testing

After each phase of the refactoring, thorough testing should be performed:

1. Verify all UI components display correctly
2. Test navigation between screens
3. Verify all functionality works as expected
4. Test on multiple screen sizes and platforms

## Future Considerations

For future UI development:

1. Implement a dependency injection system for UI components
2. Use a more formal MVC/MVVM pattern for UI components
3. Enhance the responsive design system
4. Implement better focus management for keyboard navigation
5. Add comprehensive accessibility features

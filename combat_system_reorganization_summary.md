# Combat System Reorganization Summary

## Current Issues
- Duplicate code between `/src/core/battle` and `/src/game/combat` directories
- Lack of clear separation between base functionality and game-specific implementations
- Difficulty maintaining and extending the combat system
- Inconsistent naming conventions

## Solution
We've reorganized the combat system by:
1. Creating base classes in `/src/base/combat` that define core functionality
2. Creating game-specific implementations in `/src/game/combat` that extend these base classes
3. Ensuring proper inheritance and type safety
4. Removing duplicate code

## Completed Work

### Base Classes Created
- `BaseBattleData.gd`: Base class for managing battle state and configuration
- `BaseBattleRules.gd`: Base class for battle rules and constants
- `BaseCombatManager.gd`: Base class for combat management

### Game-Specific Implementations
- `FiveParsecsBattleData.gd`: Five Parsecs implementation of battle data
- `FiveParsecsBattleRules.gd`: Five Parsecs implementation of battle rules
- `FiveParsecsCombatManager.gd`: Five Parsecs implementation of combat manager

### Files Removed
- `/src/core/battle/BattleData.gd`
- `/src/core/battle/BattleRules.gd`
- `/src/core/battle/CombatManager.gd`
- `/src/game/combat/BattleData.gd`
- `/src/game/combat/BattleRules.gd`
- `/src/game/combat/CombatManager.gd`

## Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Improved code reusability
- Better type safety and error checking
- Consistent naming conventions
- Reduced code duplication

## Next Steps
1. Update references to the old files throughout the codebase
2. Create unit tests for the new classes
3. Implement any remaining combat-related classes following the same pattern
4. Document the new architecture for future developers

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring all references to the old files are updated
- Maintaining backward compatibility during the transition
- Ensuring all game-specific functionality is properly implemented
- Handling edge cases and special behaviors

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each base class
2. Unit tests for each game-specific implementation
3. Integration tests for the combat system as a whole
4. Manual testing of combat scenarios

## Documentation
- Update code documentation to reflect the new architecture
- Create architecture diagrams showing the relationships between classes
- Document the extension points for future game-specific implementations

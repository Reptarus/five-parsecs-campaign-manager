GUT fixes applied:

1. Fixed OutputText.tscn file - it was empty/corrupt (only 1 byte) and has been recreated
2. Updated RunResults.gd - fixed the font handling methods for Godot 4.x
3. Updated OutputText.gd - fixed the _set_font method to work with Godot 4.x's font system
4. Updated GutScene.gd - fixed the _set_font method for Godot 4.x compatibility

These changes should resolve the issues with the GUT plugin in Godot 4.4.

Test Framework Fixes Applied:

1. Fixed GUT plugin OutputText.tscn - recreated the file that was corrupted
2. Fixed RunResults.gd - repaired font handling for Godot 4.x
3. Fixed OutputText.gd - updated _set_font method for Godot 4.x font system
4. Fixed GutScene.gd - updated _set_font method for Godot 4.x compatibility
5. Added get_current_test_object method to campaign_test.gd to fix test execution error
6. Fixed truncated load_json_results method in RunResults.gd
7. Removed duplicate get_current_test_object method from test_campaign_manager.gd

These linter errors are expected and can be ignored:
- "Could not resolve super class inheritance" warnings in test files
  (These occur because the test files extend from specialized test classes that
   aren't available in the editor's static analysis)

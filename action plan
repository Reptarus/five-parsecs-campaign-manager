## Implementation Notes

### Core Rules Integration
1. **Campaign Turn Sequence**: Follow the exact flow from p.78-100 of core_rules.md
   - Travel Steps (ship movement)
   - New World Arrival (world generation)
   - World Steps (story events, missions, trading)

2. **Character System**: Implement according to p.26-41
   - Start with the crew creation process
   - Follow the exact stat blocks and mechanics

3. **Battle Results**: Focus on recording results rather than simulation
   - Players will handle the physical battle on the table
   - App should focus on setup and outcome recording

4. **Rulebook Accuracy**: For each system, directly reference the corresponding rulebook pages
   - Copy exact tables and algorithms where possible
   - Match the exact terminology used in the rulebook
   - When in doubt, prioritize rulebook accuracy over implementation convenience

### Data Utilization Strategy
1. Use the extensive JSON data files in the `/data` directory as primary sources:
   - `character_creation_data.json` for character generation
   - `mission_templates.json` for mission creation
   - `planet_types.json` and `location_types.json` for world generation
   - `weapons.json` and `armor.json` for equipment

2. Create data loaders for each major system that:
   - Load and validate data at startup
   - Provide efficient access methods
   - Include error handling for missing or corrupt data

### UI Standards (Updated)
1. **File Organization**:
   - **Screens**: All UI screens should be placed in `src/ui/screens/` and organized by feature
   - **Components**: Reusable UI components should be placed in `src/ui/components/`
   - **Resources**: UI resources (themes, styles, etc.) should be placed in `src/ui/resource/`

2. **Component Design**:
   - Components should have clear separation of concerns
   - Components should be designed for reusability
   - Complex screens should be composed of smaller components

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use the standardized ResponsiveContainer for responsive layouts
   - Design UI for multiple screen sizes and orientations

4. **Documentation**:
   - Each directory should have a README.md file
   - Each component should have clear usage examples
   - Document the purpose and integration points for complex UI screens

### Rulebook Mechanics Already Implemented
Several key rulebook mechanics have already been successfully implemented:
- **âœ“ Experience Calculation** - Updated to match rulebook's XP system (character advancement)
- **âœ“ Injury Tables** - Added detailed injury tables with proper outcomes and recovery times
- **âœ“ Loot Generation** - Updated to use the appropriate loot tables from rulebook
- **âœ“ Rival System** - Added proper rival generation mechanics per rulebook
- **âœ“ Patron Relationships** - Added patron relationship tracking per rulebook

INTRODUCTION
WELCOME
You’re about to enter Fringe Space.
Behind you, a few jumps from this decrepit
starport, lie the Core Worlds: gleaming
megacities and bustling space ports, with
Unity armed forces maintaining security
and safety.
Unity stands as a beacon of human
achievement: a galactic body that governs
the most advanced civilization Humanity
has ever seen. Life on the Core Worlds is
comfortable, your health guaranteed by
genetic updating, your safety guaranteed
by the might of the star fleet, your
retirement guaranteed by correctly filling
out Form 274C and supplemental form
37C-3 (first 4 pages only).
Here, in front of you, is the Fringe:
a scattered array of worlds that defy
generalization, anarchistic colonies of
determined frontier settlers, crime-ridden
concrete towns, corporate-controlled
extraction bases, and battle-grounds for
warlords and pirates.
Opportunities for credits are everywhere
you care to look: mercenary work, doing
dirty jobs for the corporations, helping
solve the trouble of some colony. If you
have a ship to your name and a crew you
can trust, you can go far.
Sometimes it even pays well. Find allies
when you can, because your enemies will
certainly remember your face. Nobody
makes it very far on their own.
Of course, you may not live to spend
Introduction
your ill-gotten gains. Maybe you end up
face-down in the radioactive sand after a
shoot-out. Maybe you’re collateral damage
in a Galactic War invasion. Maybe you try to
pet a Krorg.
You might meet some exciting people
out here. Nomadic remnants of old settler
groups. Fanatic devotees to some alien
religion. People who have gone psycho.
Got anything remotely valuable in your
collection and you better be prepared
to fend off the inevitable starport scum
looking for easy pickings.
There’s lots of aliens too. K’Erin are usually
looking for a fight, but it doesn’t hurt to
hire one. Just don’t challenge them to a
duel – they take that serious. Little lizard
guy over there? We call them The Swift. I
hope you don’t mind the chirping sound
– they make that all day long.The odd-
looking ones in the masks are Engineers.
Can talk directly to a computer and make
it work. Invaluable in a crew.And if you
keep your eyes open, you might see a few
Precursors roaming around.They say they
are enlightened beyond the likes of you
and me.
If you prefer someone less prone to bleeding
out, maybe you’ll meet the Soulless.
They’re robots but they have personalities
like you or I, only connected to a hive-mind.
It’s like having 20 million friends.
Not all aliens you meet are as talkative
though. If the Converted make planetfall,
get off-world or your body will end up
recycled as one of their troopers.And if you
meet the Swarm, you’ll be busy reloading
until they rip your crew to tiny pieces.
But at least it’ll be memorable, right?
Introduction
ADVENTURE WARGAMING
What you are reading is a different type
of game.Where miniatures games have
traditionally been about building armies
and fighting generic battles,Adventure
Wargaming is about a lot more: it’s about
games that can be played on your own time,
which reward your investment by providing
an exciting story and which do not require
hundreds of dollars of investment simply to
play a game.
We believe that there’s a whole new world
of gaming out there, waiting for you, and we
are excited to be part of this world with Five
Parsecs from Home and many more exciting
games in the future.
Traditional miniatures wargames tend to be
played as single battles, absent of context,
often competitive, and usually played using
army lists.The forces are usually (though not
always) military formations fighting to achieve
an assortment of objectives.This game differs
in a number of important ways:
• The game assumes a campaign
is being played, with each game
informing the next.The same crew
carries over, acquiring new weapons
and experience, providing context
to the game experience. Rather than
simply being five space-soldiers, they
are your captain’s crew, who you’ve
commanded for weeks. If any of them
don’t make it, you not only lose out on
vital experience, you may also go into
the next battle short-handed.
• As such,the campaign becomes episodic,
each campaign turn building on previous
consequences.This happens on two
levels. On one hand, the events of each
game affect the future: Rumors your crew
find lead to Quests, and your victories
may result in Rivals coming back to attack
you. But it also works on a much more
personal level.The events of the game
start linking together in seemingly logical
chains of events.You just lost a mission
and a crew member died, and now
someone else in the crew is depressed?
It’s just a random event, but suddenly
it all makes sense. Over the course of a
campaign, your game will start feeling
more like a story or television show than
a mere miniatures game.
• Games are open-ended.While you may
have a specific objective to accomplish,
you are also trying to manage your
crew. Is risking casualties worth the
increased payout? Sometimes there is
no objective other than survival, and if
your campaign consists of 10, 20, or 30
battles, winning or losing a specific one
becomes less important.
• There is no strict points system, and
there is no inherent guarantee that every
battle is balanced perfectly for you.Some
encounters will be easy wins, others will
be tough.You may be so outgunned
that the mission is impossible.You must
make the decisions a real commander
would have to make in this case.
Running away is an option!
Lastly, of course, while soldiers and armies do
feature in our game, it is not necessarily about
military forces.Any number of characters can
be encountered, from pirates and adventurers
to colonists and robots. Likewise, they can do
battle for any number of reasons: rivalries,
being hired by opposing sides, or simply
because it seemed like the thing to do.

Adventure Wargaming
CONVENTIONS OF THE GAME
Game Length
Five Parsecs from Home is played in
campaign turns.After creating a crew of
characters, each turn allows you to explore the
location they are in, travel to new worlds, and
trade for equipment using these rules and
your dice, based on your crew’s decisions.
Each campaign turn, you will also fight a
miniature-based tabletop battle, before
resolving long-term consequences such as
injuries and deaths, and gaining experience
and items.
A campaign goes on as long as you like.
You can play a single scenario, while some
players prefer to follow a single personal
character, ending that campaign only if the
character dies. Others decide on a set number
of campaign turns, or just play until they feel
their crew is either forced to disband, or has
made it big and can retire.
Players who prefer a more explicit story can
utilize the Story Track (Appendix V, p.153),
which offers a series of campaign events
linked together narratively.
The game needn’t be played solo, either. If
you’d like to play with a friend or two, simply
split the crew between you, and work together
to overcome the challenges of the universe.
Creative players can even design a unique
scenario and run it as a Game Master.
In the end, the goal is to have a fun story you
can look back on.
Game Scale
We use the terms “character” and “figure”
interchangably in the game rules.
The game is meant to be played with any
figures you enjoy, and players are free to
mix and match figures from different figure
companies.There is a huge array on the
market for both army and adventuring types,
the most common being 15mm and 28mm
scale. For those new to this type of game,
“scale” refers to the approximate height of
the figure, though every company measures
this differently, and they can vary significantly
in bulk and stature. Small height differences
tend to disappear on a gaming table, so feel
free to mix and match.
All figures should be based individually, so
each figure can move on its own.This is typical
for science fiction games, but may present a
challenge for fans of very small figure ranges
(such as 6mm miniatures, which have a long
sci-fi association).
All measurements in Five Parsecs from
Home are given in inches. Players using
15mm scale miniatures may prefer to read
some measurements as centimeters. If so,
weapon ranges will still look better in inches,
but movement can feel a bit quick. Players in
6mm and 10mm scale are encouraged to use
centimeters instead.
Dice Basics
Five Parsecs from Home uses common six-
sided dice (“D6”), but also the less common
ten-sided dice (“D10”) available from many
hobby shops and game retailers, whether
individually, or as part of a polyhedral set.
When referring to rolling multiple dice
together, the number of dice is given before
the type of dice, so that “2D6” means rolling
two six-sided dice and “2D10” means rolling
two ten-sided dice. Unless otherwise stated,
you would add the result of the two dice
together, although this game also includes
occasions where you will be instructed to take
the higher or lower die result.
8
Conventions of the Game
Sometimes, you will be asked for a modified
roll, adding or subtracting a number to the
dice roll for the final result. For example, if you
see “2D6+2”, this means roll two six-sided
dice, add them together, and then add 2 for
the result.
Additionally, you may be asked to roll “D100”.
Unless you are fortunate enough to have a
one-hundred-sided die, this means rolling
the D10 twice, the first result for ‘tens’ and
the second for ‘units’, to generate a number
between 1 (01) and 100 (00). So, a result of 5,
then 8, would be 58.
Rerolls and Natural Rolls
If the rules say you can reroll something, the
die or dice are picked up and rolled again,
with the original result no longer counting.
In some cases, multiple rules may suggest
further rerolls.This is not permitted: only one
reroll is allowed per circumstance.
If the rules call for a natural roll, it means you
must roll that number on the dice before any
modifications are applied. For example, only
a rolled “6” counts as a natural 6, not a “4”
modified with a +2.
If the rules allow rolling twice for something
and picking the better result, you may roll at
the same time or one after the other. It doesn’t
matter which.
The game occasionally requires finding a
random direction.You can purchase various
“direction dice”, but a simple solution is to roll
a D10 and use the raised tip as the direction.

Norms of the Game
The rules assume a Human player facing
opponents controlled by the game system
(the “enemy”).The actions an enemy may
take are defined and described on page 42.
If the rules say you “may” do something, you
can choose not to. If the rules say you “must”
or “will” do something, you are required to
do so.
By default, the game rules assume the player
will pre-measure distances as they play.You
may opt to commit to a move or shot before
measuring, if you prefer. In multi-player
games, all players should agree before the
campaign begins.
Game Currencies
These rules assume an in-world currency
known as credits, a kind of universal money.
They also refer to experience points, most
commonly written as XP, which most
characters spend to improve themselves
over time.You can also use and acquire story
points, a method of buying better results and
some rerolls during the campaign.All these
are currencies you will want to track on your
Crew Log at the back of these rules, and all of
these will be explained later in the rules.

Norms of the Game
Common Sense
Five Parsecs from Home is a complex game
with a ton of creatures, weapons, items,
events, and things that can all happen at
the same time. It is entirely possible you
encounter a random situation that playtesters
didn’t, and which there is not a specific rule to
cover. If so, re-read each involved rule carefully
for guidance.The rules are usually meant to
be read and applied literally, but if you are still
not content with the outcome, consider the
intent behind the rules.A result that is clearly
at odds with the spirit of the mechanic must
be taken to be wrong.
In the end, once this game is in your hands,
you’re in control of the experience: you
can simply decide the interpretation that
works best for you. If you run into such
fringe situations, please let us know so we
can consider the complications – and your
solutions – for future editions and updates.
Essential Miniatures
If you are an experienced science fiction
gamer, you may already have a collection of
miniatures and terrain ready to go. Should
you be new to this, it may be overwhelming to
get started, especially in terms of miniatures.
This chapter is not meant to be a complete
introduction to miniatures gaming, but will
help you understand what you need to play
Five Parsecs from Home.
This section assumes you are playing with
miniatures, though paper figures are gaining
popularity, and are very accessible. Even then,
you will need to know how many to print out.
Your Crew
You will need a collection of suitable crew
figures. It is common to recycle figures when
a character leaves or dies, so 6-7 character
figures will do you fine to start with. Over time,
a collection of 10-15 suitable figures will give
you some options to pick from.
You will need to be able to tell your figures
apart, and the easier this is, the better. If you
use figures from the same set, such as the
many futuristic military miniature ranges
available, try to use distinctive poses or vary
the paint designs.
Your figures should reflect roughly the type
of weapons they are armed with, but as gear
changes frequently, it is not really reasonable
to try and convert all of the pistols,swords,and
rifles every time you get a new item. Especially
since characters can die rather easily!
The Enemies
For the opposition, the more and stranger
figures you have, the better.A good starting
point is three sets of enemies: one squad of
military types, one squad of gang types, and
one squad of alien types, each with eight or
so figures available.Again, make sure you
can tell some of them apart so you can
track specialists.
It is worth having an extra figure or two to use
as assorted boss and villain types. Reusing
a specific villain figure might even turn into
that being the actual same person who has
returned to battle you once again. Be creative!
That may seem like a lot of figures, but you
can start with less than that. In a campaign
where there are dozens of different enemies,
you will inevitably need some proxies.A
proxy is a figure standing in for something
else. Maybe you only have one squad for the
enemy and they get to stand in for whoever
you are fighting that day. Maybe they have
to stand in for some bug-eyed monsters too.
As long as you can play the game, you are
doing fine.You can easily start with just a
few figures and then expand as you go,
watching your collection expand as you
progress in the campaign.

CHARACTER DEFINITIONS
Ability Scores
Each of your characters is rated in five ability
scores, which you can record on a sheet of
paper, or on the Crew Log at the back of
these rules.
• Reactions is used to determine when a
character can act during a battle round.
• Speed is straightforward: how far you
can move in tabletop inches.
• Combat Skill is added to all attack dice
rolls.
• Toughness is the number that enemies
have to roll above if they want to
damage you.
• Savvy covers technical aptitude, wits,
and a bit of charm. It’s usually used
away from the battlefield.
Next to each ability score below is listed the
base starting value for a new character and
the maximum possible for a Human player
character. Depending on what happens to the
character during character creation, some of
these values may go up. Depending on what
happens during the campaign, they might go
down as well!
ABILITY
STARTING
VALUE
MAXIMUM
VALUE
Reactions 1 6
Speed 4” 8”
Combat Skill +0 +5
Toughness 3 6
Savvy +0 +5
Luck Points
Particular characters may have (or may
develop) an unusual degree of Luck, as
destiny smiles on them. On the battlefield,
this works to avoid a potentially lethal injury.
Humans are the only species that are allowed
more than one point of Luck.
CHARACTER
CREATION

Character Creation
CREW COMPOSITION
Selecting Your Crew
There are four methods you may use to create
your crew.We have included a step-by-step
example of what character and crew creation
might look like at the end of this section,
and if you are eager to jump straight into the
game, you can simply use the example crew.
If you’re creating your own crew, grab a copy
of the Crew Log in the back of this book, or
download a copy from www.modiphius.net
First-timer Method
If you are playing for the first time, keeping
track of multiple characters can be confusing.
If so,start with a crew of 6 Human characters,or
use the example crew at the end of this chapter.
Standard Method
You receive 6 crew figures:
• 3 are always Human.
• 2 may be Human or a Primary Alien,
according to your choice.
• 1 may be a Human or Bot, according to
your choice.
If you have opted for a reduced crew size (see
page 63), you may still select up to 1 Bot and
2 Primary Aliens.
Miniatures Method
Select 6 miniatures you would like to play
with from your collection, then choose from
the crew types below to match your selected
miniature figures.You should still roll for the
specific advances and background details
as normal.
This option allows you to have any combination
of Primary Aliens, Bots, or Humans that
matches your selected miniatures.
Random Method
You receive 6 crew figures. Roll on the Crew
Type Tables below for each position.
Under this method, each character is
generated completely at random.
13
Crew Composition
Crew Type Tables
Step 1
If using the random method, roll for the basic crew type first. If you roll Primary Alien or Strange
Character, proceed to the relevant subtable, and roll for the exact type.
ROLL CREW TYPE

61-80 Primary Alien
81-90 Bot
91-100 Strange Character
ROLL PRIMARY ALIEN
1-20 Engineer
21-40 K’Erin
41-55 Soulless
56-70 Precursor
71-90 Feral

Step 2
Note down the basic character profile and any
special rules and characteristics that apply to
them. If the character is a Bot, you are now done;
go to Step 4.
Step 3
If the character is a Baseline Human or Primary
Alien, proceed to the Background, Motivation,
and ClassTables (pp.24-27),and roll once on each.
Apply any modifiers to the character abilities, and
note any additional resources gained.
If the character is from the Strange Character
Subtable,consult the specific entry to see if any of
the three rolls are modified or altered in any way.

Crew Composition
Human Characters
Baseline Human
Baseline Human characters are plain, ordinary
people. Distributed across thousands of
worlds, cultures, and environments, their
appearance, customs, and outlook on life can
vary tremendously, but ultimately the baseline
is Human, through and through.
They begin the game with the following profile:
REACTIONS 1
SPEED 4”
COMBAT SKILL +0
TOUGHNESS 3
SAVVY +0
They have a single advantage: they are the only
character type that can exceed 1 point of Luck.
Proceed to roll once on each of the
Background, Motivation, and Class Tables
(pp.24-27), applying the results from each.
Bots
Standard Bot
Typical Bots are built to a bewildering array
of configurations, but the profile given here
will fit most combat, security, and multi-
purpose Bots.They are fitted with emotion-
simulation modules, allowing fairly complex
“personalities”.
They begin the game with the following profile:
REACTIONS 2
SPEED 4”
COMBAT SKILL +1
TOUGHNESS 4
SAVVY +2
Bots have the following characteristics and
advantages:
• Bots do not make any rolls on the
character creation tables.All Bots simply
begin with the base profile listed above.
• Bots have a separate table for Injuries in
the campaign chapter.
• They receive a 6+ Armor Saving Throw,
due to their metallic construction.
• Bot characters do not earn Experience
Points. Instead they can be upgraded
through the expenditure of credits.
• Bots cannot benefit from implants or the
use of any consumables in battle.
• They cannot be the subject of a Character
Event under any circumstances. If you
have to select a random crew member
through a Character Event, do not
include Bots in the roll.
Primary Aliens
These are the most common alien species
found in crews around Fringe space. Note
that, although many of these species can be
encountered as enemies as well, any rules
indicated here apply only to the player’s crew.
Proceed to roll once on each of the
Background, Motivation, and Class Tables
(pp.24-27), applying the results from each.
Some results may seem odd, but the type of
character that wants to join an adventuring
crew often has a rather weird, complex, or
even conflicted personality. Soulless are
programmed to emulate Human behavior,
and still roll normally, while non-Humans tend
to have the same institutions as Humanity, but
are rather different in outlook or appearance.

immediately. If you are unable to do so,
lose this trait permanently.
• Motivation is always Order.
Mysterious Past
They never talk about where they came
from.Almost as if they don’t even know.
Create the character as a Baseline Human,but
roll twice on the Background Table and apply
both results. However, when rolling on the

a casualty.
• The first time they become a casualty
(without any more Luck to save them)
they lose all Luck points permanently,
and can never receive them again. From
that point on, they no longer receive the
bonus XP for being a Hopeful Rookie.
Genetic Uplift
All manner of genetic adjustments are
possible with the basic Human template.
This could, of course, be used to create
literal super-humans, if you have the cash.

Crew Composition
Background, Motivation,
and Class
Rolls on the following tables provide a sense
of who the character is and where they
originated from. Of course, these results
should be interpreted in light of other factors:
• Many rolls provide increases to ability
scores which are applied immediately.
• A High-tech colony for Ferals would
be a primitive dump for an Engineer,
while a Precursor Primitive would likely
be a voluntary exile in pursuit of some
spiritual achievement.
• The Resources column may grant extra
credits, Quest Rumors, known Patrons,
or story points. Simply note down all
of these things on the Crew Log.Their
importance will be clear once you begin
the campaign.All such resources are
pooled together – they are not specific
to a particular character.
Bonus Equipment and Weapon rolls provide
items which the character has as they arrive
at the campaign.They do not have to retain
these and they may be handed to other
characters or sold normally. It’s worth noting
that some results will be more desirable than
others. Not everybody was born with the same
opportunities, so reallocating equipment
between crew members might be necessary
to start with.
Note that the tables intentionally do not
depend on each other.You can have a
character that grew up in a high-tech
environment and became a primitive outcast.
Be creative and come up with a story as to how
that went down.
Leaders
Once you have created all of your characters,
pick one to be the Leader.This character
receives 1 Luck point and will never leave the
crew through random events, though they can
certainly be slain.While you are free to select
a Bot as your Leader, they do not receive Luck
if you do.
Starting Patrons and Rivals
If you begin the game knowing a Patron,
they are always local to the world on which
you begin the campaign.When you play your
first campaign turn, simply roll up a Patron,
and assume you have known them all along.
For more information on Patrons, see p.77.
Any Rival you begin the game with should
be rolled on the Unknown Rivals Table in the
“Battle” chapter (p.94). For more information
on Rivals, see p.77.

Crew Equipment
Ship Details
Your crew’s final piece of equipment is also
their largest, their most valuable, and the
most important for the adventure: The Ship.
Roll once on the table below to determine
what your starting ship is. Note that not all
vessels are created equal, and sometimes you
have to make do with what you could lay your
hands on.
Three factors are determined from here:
• How much debt you start the game in
(see p.76).
• How many Hull Points the ship has, i.e.
how much damage it can sustain before
it is destroyed.
• If the ship has any special traits.
Emergency Drives: If you have to perform
an emergency take-off while your ship is
damaged, reduce the Hull damage sustained
on the roll by 3.
Fuel-efficient: When traveling to a new world,
the fuel cost is reduced by 1 credit.
Fuel Hog: When traveling to a new world, the
fuel cost is increased by 1 credit.
Standard Issue: The cost of all Starship
Components (see p.60) is reduced by 1 credit.
Dodgy Drive: Any time the ship takes Hull
damage, roll 2D6. If the roll is equal to or
below the amount of damage sustained,
the drive is misbehaving, and 2 additional
points of damage are sustained.
Armored: Any time the ship takes damage,
you lose 1 Hull Point less than indicated by
the rules.

CHARACTER CREATION EXAMPLE
I choose to build a crew for a new campaign.
Since I don’t have many alien figures available,
I go with a crew of 6 Human characters. I could
proxy in some figures, but I prefer to have
things look like they should. If I recruit alien
characters later, I can find some new figures
online to add to the collection.
That means everyone starts with the same
basic profile:

Now I need to roll for their background,
motivation, and class. I’ll do each character one
at a time.
Figure 1:
• Background: Giant, Overcrowded
Dystopian City.This grants +1” Speed.
• Motivation: Freedom, which starts me
off with 2 XP.
• Class: Trader, starting us with 2D6
additional credits. I roll 2+3 = 5.
Seems like a classic television hero, yearning
to get out there and do something for himself.
This will be our captain unless I roll someone
better. I decide they’re afraid of being tied
down, but also dislike being alone. I add a
name: Flint Williamson.

Patron and a +1 Combat Skill bonus.
Clearly a tough guy who’s used to scrapping.
I decide he has old contacts in the mining
corp, and with sector law enforcement where
he worked before mustering out. He’s a
dependable sort who isn’t afraid of bruising
his knuckles.

• Class: Punk, earning 2 XP and a Rival.
I’m going to say she’s the rebel kid who
might have ended up in a gang, if she hadn’t
grown up on a scientifically-minded research
station. She was always more interested in cool
gadgets than she was in doing research.

I like the idea of this being an old, veteran

retiring on a Unity armed forces pension, so
now he’s taken to the stars to find a better deal.

As I want Flint as my Leader, I add a point of
Luck to his profile.
Equipment:
I get 3 rolls for Military Weapons, but for each
character with a Savvy increase, I can take one
of them as a High-tech Weapon instead. I’m
going to do that for two of the weapons, and
I roll up a Blast Pistol and a Hand Laser. I
figure Nada can take the Blast Pistol, and Flint
takes the Hand Laser.A roll on the Military
Weapons Table grants me a Marksman’s Rifle,
which Twitch lays claim to.
Next, I roll for 3 Low-tech Weapons, getting
a Handgun, a Hunting Rifle, and a Shotgun.
Tank seems the sort to appreciate a Shotgun,
while Shi picks up the Hunting Rifle. Simon
likes to think of himself as a more discerning
type these days, so a Handgun will do for him.
In addition to the 4 rolls granted already, a new
crew gets 1 Gear roll automatically for a total of
5 Gear rolls.The dice grant me a Camo Cloak,
a Scanner, an Assault Blade, a Frag Vest, and
a Laser Sight.
Shi’s Gadget roll plus the one a new crew gets
means 2 Gadget rolls, which turn out to be a
Battle Visor and a Boosted Arm. I hand these
items out to the characters I feel they would fit
the best.
For money, I begin with 6 credits (= 6 person
crew) plus the money I rolled up: A healthy
bank account of 17 credits.
I note down the group has 2 Patrons and 2
Rivals known on the starting world.
Other Details
A roll on the Ship Table gives us a Worn
Freighter.We have 25 credits of debt on it,
so that’s not too bad. It has 30 Hull Points,
and no special traits.
For Flavor, I roll up that our crew is
characterized as Hardened Rebels and we met
through Being in Trouble with Authorities. I
love it when a plan comes together!
When I set up the campaign (p.63) I’ll add one
story point to my roll.
And with that I am ready to take on the stars!

GAME CURRENCIES
Credits
A generic Unity-backed form of monetary unit,
credits are accepted virtually everywhere,
and can be traded for most goods. Likewise, a
complex system of barter is in place allowing all
manner of unlikely items to be traded from one
cornerof thegalaxytotheother.Inthecampaign
game, we simplify this all into the credit.
Credits are accumulated in a single pool for
your crew, accessible by any crew member
at any time.You do not need to track what
money each character is carrying, and credits
are never lost due to casualties.
If anything is worth less than 1 credit, then it
is assumed to be irrelevant to the campaign
game.Your crew may have any number of
martini glasses, holo-stims, and fancy cigars.
Experience Points
Characters progress in the game by various
methods – by acquiring better ships, better
weapons, better equipment – but also by
earning Experience Points (XP) from events
and completing missions. Unlike the crew’s
Stash of equipment or credits, which may be
shared between crew members, track each
character’s XP individually.When they have
enough, they will be able to spend them to
buy Character Upgrades, which increase that
character’s statistics.
Quest Rumors
You may obtain Quest Rumors (also referred
to simply as Rumors) in the campaign, as well
as during character creation.You should also
track Rumors as a single pool for the whole
crew. Each campaign turn you will roll to see if
the Rumors lead to a Quest. If your crew is on
an active Quest, any new Rumors you obtain
will help towards resolution of the Quest you
are currently on.
For flavor, roll D10 to determine what
nature the Rumor takes.This does not affect
gameplay.
ROLL RUMOR IS
1-2 An extracted data file
3-4 Notebook with secret information
5-6 Old map showing a location
7-8 A tip from a contact

Main Rules
TERRAIN RULES
Terrain Types
Gaming terrain can take a number of forms,
based on their visual appearance, shape, and
how figures interact with them. Many other
game rules rely on how you have designated a
piece of terrain.Terrain should fall into one of
the following categories:
Linear: Any long,wide feature that a miniature
cannot generally be placed on top of.
Examples: walls, security fences, and sandbag
barricades.
Individual: A single piece of terrain that a
figure cannot climb.
Examples: barrels, individual trees, and sign
posts.
Area: Features that cover a larger space on the
table,whichminiaturescanbeplacedwithin.Area
features block Line of Sight (see p.38),and may
be designated as Difficult terrain (see p.38).
Examples: forest, bushes, and rubble.
Field: Similar to an Area feature, except that
such terrain does not block Line of Sight.
Field features may also be designated as
Difficult or Impassable (see p.38). Field terrain
cannot provide Cover (see p.39).
Examples: mud, water, and lava pools.
Block: A terrain piece that can be climbed or
otherwise interacted with, but which figures
cannot enter into.
Examples: boulders, sealed shipping
containers, or locked-up buildings.
Interior: An enclosed terrain piece that
figures can enter.
Examples: buildings, tunnels, and caves.
Interaction
Block and Linear features can generally be
climbed.Area features can be entered, as can
many Field features.The “Movement” rules
chapter (p.41) discusses how this influences
movement.
37
Terrain Rules
Difficult and Impassable Terrain
Some terrain features may be designated
as Difficult terrain.This affects the speed at
which figures can cross such terrain. Difficult
terrain will consume an additional 1” of
movement allowance for every full 2” moved
in it. Difficult terrain includes features such as
forest, swamp, rubble, and sand. Figures that
fly may do so without reduced movement.
Impassable terrain cannot be crossed by any
figure except when using flight, and for some
terrain, you may declare that this too is not
possible.
If playing a multi-player game, you should
agree what terrain descriptors are applied to
all terrain pieces before the game begins.
Lines of Sight
A Line of Sight is an imaginary line between
two figures, establishing if they can see and
fire upon each other. In most cases, visibility is
obvious. If in doubt, leaning down and getting
a look from behind one of the figures will give
you a “true” Line of Sight. If you can see the
whole figure, then they can be fired at with no
penalty.If you are uncertain,and the positioning
is awkward, a laser line tool, or a length of
string pulled taut can be used to check.
Lines of Sight are considered mutual by
default. If a figure is obscured by certain types
of terrain that they are adjacent to (within 1”),
it is assumed that figure is using it to avoid
being hit by an attacker, in which case, they
gain the benefit of Cover (see below).
Shooting across Linear Obstacles
Linear obstacles are ignored for Line of Sight
purposes if the target figure is entirely visible
over them.This is typically the case when the
shooter is placed on a raised terrain feature,
such as a rooftop. Otherwise, Line of Sight
exists, and the target receives the benefits of
Cover unless the shooter is within 1” of the
obstacle (such as firing from directly behind
a wall).
Shooting past Things
If the Line of Sight is obscured by a stray
item, such as an Individual terrain feature (a
rock or tree is often the culprit), Line of Sight
is not blocked as long as they are at least
partially visible.
Shooting past People
If Line of Sight is partially obscured by another
figure, Line of Sight is blocked, regardless of
which side the intervening figure belongs to.
Area Features
• Line of Sight into an Area feature
terminates at the nearest edge.
• Any figure placed in the feature, but
touching an edge, can see and be seen
from that side of the edge.
• Figures within an Area feature and not
touching an edge cannot see figures on
the outside.
• Figures within the same Area feature can
see each other if they are within 3”.
Miniatures in Peculiar Poses
Some miniatures are in dramatic poses, with raised arms, tails sticking out, and so forth.
Clearly our imaginary characters are not quite so eager to have their limbs shot, so Lines of
Sight and Cover should be based on the body of the figure.
38
Terrain Rules
Cover
Cover makes it more difficult to hit a target
at range (see Combat, p.44), and moving
across the battlefield using Cover is certainly
wiser than standing in the open! A figure
is considered to be in Cover for combat
purposes if any of the following are true:
• Line of Sight crossed any terrain feature
more than 1” from the firer.
• The figure is positioned within an
Area feature
• The figure is in contact with a terrain
feature that partially obscures Line
of Sight.
Adjudicating Line of Sight
and Cover
In general, the game plays best if you are
somewhat generous with Lines of Sight as
well as being somewhat generous with Cover.
In other words:
If in doubt, allow the shot to be made but
count it as Cover.
Cover Example 2:
Figure A is within 1” of a waist-high wall. Figure B is
10” away from the wall.
When B fires on A,A will receive Cover as it crosses
the obstacle.
When A fires on B, B does not count as being in
Cover, as B is not within 1” of the obstacle.
Cover Example 1:
Figure B is at the edge of a forested
Area feature, while figure A is in the
open.
Figure B receives Cover. Figure A does
not receive Cover when fired upon
by B.

Terrain Rules
ACTIONS
The Battle stage of each campaign round is
split into phases (see p.112). Player characters
acting within each phase can act in any order
desired.When acting, a figure may make
a Movement Action and then perform a
Combat Action.A figure may opt to forego
either option, but cannot perform them in
reverse order.
A Combat Action typically means firing a
weapon or Brawling, but some other actions
on the battlefield may require the use of that
figure’s Combat Action for that round.
Some activities are Free Actions, such as
using a consumable item.A character can
perform one Free Action without inhibiting
their other activities. Carrying out two Free
Actions in the same round requires foregoing
the Combat Action.
Stunned
If a figure becomes Stunned, the next time
they act, they may Move OR perform a Combat
Action, but not both. Being Stunned does not
prevent taking a Free Action.
Characters can accumulate multiple Stun
markers. If a character ever has 3 or more
Stun markers at the same time, they are
knocked out and removed from play.
After a Stunned figure has acted, remove a
Stun marker. Once all of its Stun markers
have been removed, it can return to using
both a Movement and Combat Action each
round as normal.
In the event a Stunned character is attacked in
Brawling combat, remove all Stun markers,
but the attacker receives a +1 dice bonus for
every Stun marker that was removed.
40
Actions
Stunned enemies
Stunned enemies will always fire at the
nearest target, if one is visible. If no target is
available, they will retreat to try to find better
Cover or behind a terrain feature. Stunned
enemies will not enter Brawling combat.
Suitable Stun markers
You might use beads or tiny dice as
Stun markers.A more visually pleasing
option is to use small bits of crumbled
paper or tufts of cotton to look like
smoke puffs from bullet impacts.
MOVEMENT
When moving, a figure may move up to their
Speed in tabletop inches.Terrain features do
not typically reduce movement speeds, but
Difficult terrain will consume an additional
1” of movement allowance for every full 2”
moved in it (see “Terrain Types”, p.37).
Opening doors costs 1” of movement.
Climbing through a window or hole costs 2”.
A figure cannot move directly through another
figure at any time.
Dash
Characters that do not intend to take a Combat
Action can Dash, allowing them to move an
additional 2”. Enemies will do so to reach
Cover or move into range.An enemy with a
ranged weapon will not Dash if they are able
to fire at a target.
Proximity
If a figure moves into contact with one or more
opponents, they engage in a Brawl, which
is resolved immediately (see p.45). No other
actions are permitted. Figures may not enter a
Brawl by Dashing.
K’Erin that can move to an enemy without
Dashing must do so, and fight a Brawl.
Moving Up and Down
Vertical obstacles can be traversed by simply
paying the height of the obstacle in inches.
For example, crossing a 2” tall wall uses 2” of
movement allowance. Figures cannot end a
move part-way up a surface or wall.
A descent of 1” or less can be performed for
free.Any longer drop requires the character
to either climb down (with the same cost as
climbing up), or Jump.
41
Movement
Jumping
Jumping does not require any available
movement, meaning a character can move
to an edge and Jump down.Jumping down
more than 1” ends the characters round.
Jumping down 3” or further inflicts a Damage
+0 Hit (see p.46).
Swift characters can Jump straight down any
distance and sustain no damage.
Leaping
Characters can leap over a gap up to 2”
wide, counting it as part of their standard
movement. Swift characters may leap over
gaps up to 4”.
Random Movement
A battle event or effect may cause a character
to move randomly. Unless stated otherwise,
determine the direction of movement
and then move the figure its full standard
movement distance in a straight line.The
character will halt and become Stunned if
they contact a terrain feature.
If a randomly moving character collides with
another character, the moving character
comes to a halt and is Stunned.The character
collided with is pushed 1” along the direction
of movement and then Stunned.
Alternative Movement Actions
Some characters may have access to different
modes of movement that replace their
normal movement, such as powered jumps
or teleportation. Using an Alternative
Movement Action replaces the normal
Movement Action.The character may decide
which movement to use each round.They
cannot be used to replace a Dash.
A teleporting character that would materialize
inside a solid object suffers a spatial shift.
Move them 2D6” in a random direction.The
character receives a Stun marker when this
happens. If the new location is also inside an
object, repeat the process and place another
Stun marker. In the event a character would
emerge in a location occupied by another
character, the occupying character is Stunned
instead, and the teleporting character suffers
a spatial shift.
A character that materializes over an
Impassable terrain feature such as a lava
lake, toxic sludge pool, or similar, becomes a
casualty and is removed from the battlefield.
Swift characters may glide down from a
height. Pick a location that is below the
current position of the figure and no farther
away horizontally than the difference in the
heights of the two locations. Place the figure
at the new location. Resolve this as part of the
Alternative Movement Action.
Simply Jumping down is a Free Action for a
Swift. Gliding counts as a Swift’s Movement
Action.
Example:
If a Swift crew member is 5” above ground level
on a ledge, they could glide down to ground
level within 5”, or land on a 2” tall ledge that
was up to 3” away (the difference in height).
Enemy Movement
The way the enemy moves on the field requires
the player to inject a modest amount of
“artificial intelligence” into proceedings. It is
assumed that the player will make decisions
based on what is reasonable, but can also
operate enemies according to one of seven
broad AI types, shown below. It is up to the
player to decide how strictly to adhere to these.
Cautious
• Cautious enemies will attempt to stay in
Cover whenever possible.
• Figures with an opponent in sight and
range will remain where they are and
take Aimed shots. Otherwise, they will
advance in or behind terrain features,
42
Movement
trying to establish Line of Sight to
opposing figures.
• They will attempt to engage targets at
as close to maximum range as possible,
and will not advance voluntarily within
12” of opposition.
• As a general rule, they will not enter
Brawling combat.
Aggressive
• Aggressive enemies with opponents in
sight will advance at least half a move
towards them, attempting to remain in
Cover if possible.
• Enemies that are unable to see any
opposition, or which are within 12”, will
advance as fast as possible towards the
nearest opponent, attempting to enter
into a Brawl.
• They will not enter a Brawl with an
opponent that has higher Combat Skill.
• Heavy weapon figures will not move if
they have a Line of Sight to a target.
Tactical
• Tactical enemies will advance at half
speed, always retaining Cover where
possible.They will cross open ground at
full speed, if needed.
• They will attempt to close to within 12”
of their opponents, then will move to
outflank and get clear Line of Sight
where possible.
• If within one move and possessing
higher combat skill, they will enter a
brawl; otherwise they will fire.
• If they have a clear shot and are in
Cover, they will remain in place to Aim.
• Tactical enemies will attempt to remain
within 3” of a friendly figure whenever
possible.
Rampaging
• Rampaging enemies will move as
fast as possible towards the closest
opponent, and will always attempt to
enter Brawling combat.
• Rampagers with Heavy weapons will
stand still and fire, if in sight of a target.
Defensive
• Defensive enemies will advance to
weapons range, but will remain in their
initial half of the table, and will remain
in Cover or behind terrain whenever
possible.
• Once in position, they will fire from
those positions, standing still to Aim,
and will move to Brawl if opponents
enter their terrain features and they
have equal or better Combat Skill.
• If a terrain feature with friendlies has
been entered by the player’s forces,
those within adjacent features will move
to reinforce.
Beast
• Beast enemies will always attempt to
moveasfaraspossibletowardsthenearest
opponent, while remaining in Cover.
• They will only break Cover if they
can enter a Brawl within two moves.
Otherwise they will move to break Line
of Sight and maneuver closer.
• When possible, Beasts will attempt to
remain within 2” of a friendly figure,
attacking the same targets.
Guardian
• Guardian enemies are attached to
another figure, and must always remain
within 3” of that figure, if possible.
• They will move at the same pace and
attack the same targets using the same
methods (firing / Brawling), whenever
possible.
43
Movement
COMBAT
A figure may fire one weapon carried as a
Combat Action.
Unless within 3” of a visible opponent, you
may fire at any visible target.
Figures within 3” of a visible opponent MUST
target an enemy within 3” if they fire.
Swift characters must shoot at the closest
visible target using all available shots.
Weapons with multiple shots may resolve them
one at a time.If the target is destroyed,you may
select another target within 3” of the original.
To Hit
To Hit, roll 1D6, adding the Combat Skill of the
firer.The target number to Hit is:
• Within 6” and in the open 3+
• withinweaponrangeandintheopen
ORwithin6”andinCover 5+
• Within weapon range and in Cover 6+
Ifthemodifiedscoreisequaltoorabovethetarget
number,theshotHits.Missedshotshavenoeffect.
Watch Where You Point that Thing
If a Line of Sight crosses another character
between the firer and target, the shot cannot
be taken.This applies to both sides.
Characters attempting to take a shot that
would endanger an ally (such as using an Area
weapon) must roll 1D6 and score a 5+ to do
so. Failure means they won’t even consider it,
and must pick a different target or perform a
different action.
Enemy figures will not attempt to fire in this
way if it would endanger an ally, unless they
are Swift or Soulless. Bots of either side cannot
attempt this (Safeguard Mk II programming).
Swift and Soulless may do so without rolling.
If the shooter has ever been in a fight or
argument with the affected character (by way
of random event), they may roll twice and use
the higher score.
Combat
Brawling
Figures in physical (base) contact with each
other will fight in a Brawl during a Combat
Action, rather than firing at range.
Each character rolls 1D6, adding their Combat
Skill. K’Erin roll twice, using the better score.
Add +2 if carrying a Melee weapon, or +1 if
carrying a Pistol weapon.The lower total suffers
a Hit. On a draw, both characters take a Hit.
If either character scored a natural
(unmodified) 6, they inflict a Hit on the
opponent. If either character scored a natural
1, their opponent inflicts a Hit upon them.
These special Hits are in addition to any
inflicted from the combat itself.
Resolve Hits (see below) using the highest
Damage value of any Melee or Pistol weapon
carried. Characters with no suitable weapon
hit with Damage +0.
A character that eliminates their opponent (the
figure is removed from the battlefield) can
move 2” in any direction, but cannot enter a
new Brawl.This move is taken immediately
after the Brawl has been resolved.
Figures taking a Hit are always pushed back 1”
per Hit (see p.46).
Note that figures are never left in contact with
each other.
Stunned Opponents
If a character is engaged in a Brawl while
Stunned (see p.40), the Stun markers are
removed but the opponent receives a +1
bonus per Stun marker.
Multiple Opponents
In some cases, an attacker might end up
in contact with multiple opponents. Select
randomly who fights first. Resolve the combat
normally, with the outnumbering side getting
a +1 bonus to the Brawl roll.
If the lone fighter wins, they do not get a 2”
bonus move, but must instead immediately
fight the remaining opponent. No bonus
applies in this case.
Only two combatants can fight against a single
attacker. In the unlikely event a single attacker
manages to contact three or more opponents
in a single move, randomly select one that is
pushed back 1”.
Combat
Resolving Hits
If a character is Hit,regardless of the source,roll
1D6 and add the Damage rating of the attack.
If the result equals or exceeds the Toughness
of the target or is a natural 6, the character
becomes a casualty and is removed from play.
A roll that is less than Toughness will push
the target 1” directly away from the attacker,
unless blocked by terrain or other figures.
Mark the figure as Stunned by placing a Stun
marker next to it.
Saving Throws
Some combatants may receive a Saving
Throw because they have defensive screen or
some form of armor (enemy Saving Throws
are always due to armor).A successful Saving
Throw roll means the Hit has been deflected.
If the combatant has a Saving Throw, roll 1D6
when becoming a casualty.A roll equal to or
above the Saving Throw number negates the
Hit. However, the deflection still leaves the
figure Stunned as above.
Bot, Soulless, De-converted, and Assault Bot
characters have built-in armor plating, which
grants them a 6+ Armor Saving Throw (5+
for Assault Bots).This can be combined with
a regular suit of Armor. See “Multiple saving
throws” below.
A weapon with the Piercing trait will negate a
Saving Throw from armor. However, Saving
Throws stemming from screens are not
affected by Piercing.
Multiple Saving Throws
If a character has two or more Saving Throws,
only roll for the best Saving Throw, but lower
the target number by 1. If struck by a Piercing
weapon, only Screen Saving Throws are
counted.
Examples:
A Bot (6+ Save) is fitted with a screen
granting a 5+ Save.The combined Saving
Throw is 4+ (the screen, improved by 1), and
is considered to be a screen.
A character has acquired two sources of armor
both granting a 5+ Save.The two saves are
combined into a 4+ Save (5+ improved
by 1).
Luck
If a character with Luck would be removed as
a casualty, they lose 1 point of Luck instead.
The character is immediately moved 1D6” in a
random direction, and is otherwise unharmed,
as they dive for safety. If a character has
multiple points of Luck, they all have to be
depleted before they can become a casualty.
All Luck is regained automatically after each
battle.
Enemy Targeting
Enemies always fire at the easiest target to hit,
and will prefer a closer target to a distant one.
In the event targets are equally close, simply
pick at random.
Aiming
If a character is not Stunned and does not
Move,they can Aim their shots more accurately.
When using an Aimed shot, pick up any 1s on
the To Hit dice and roll them again once.
Tactical, Cautious, and Defensive enemies
will try to Aim when shooting from Cover.
Aggressive and Rampaging enemies will not
Aim.
Panic Fire
A character may opt to expend all their
available ammunition as quickly as possible.
This is unlikely to be very accurate, but in
an emergency, it can be helpful. If they do
engage in such Panic Fire, the character is
46
Combat
limited to firing at half the weapon’s base
Range (ignoring all range enhancements that
may be applicable).
Conduct attacks as normal, but roll 2
additional shots.Attacks are resolved one
at a time, with each being directed at the
closest available target at that moment.
After the volley is completed, the weapon
(and all identical weapons carried) is out of
ammunition for the rest of the battle.The
character may fire other weapons as normal,
and will replenish their ammo after the battle.
The Panic Fire option is never used by
enemies.
COMBAT EXAMPLE 1: SHOOTING ENCOUNTER
A crew member (A) with an Auto Rifle is getting
ready to fire on some approaching mercenary
guards (B and C).
Step 1:
Since the guards are not within 3” of my figure, I
do not have to fire at the closest target.However,I
want to fire on both of them,which I can do,as my
weapon has 2 shots, and they are within 3” apart. I
check to make sure they’re in range of my weapon,
and they are.
Step 2:
I roll to Hit.For each shot I roll D6,and add my
Combat Skill +1. Since these guards are within
weapon range and in the open, but more than 6”
away, I need a 5+ to hit them. I roll a 4 against
the closest enemy, and a 2 against the second.
Modified, that’s a 5 and a 3.The first one hits, but
the second one doesn’t.
Step 3:
I need to find out if the shot takes the enemy
out, or if they were just clipped. I roll D6.The
weapon has a Damage value of 0, so I don’t add
anything to the roll. I roll a 5 and compare this to
the Toughness of the target, which is a 4. Since I
equaled or exceeded his Toughness, he’s looking
like a casualty.
Step 4:
However,these guards are wearing armor,with a 6+
SavingThrow.IrollaD6forthedownedguard,rolling
a 3.Not good enough.That shot must have punched
rightthrough.Iremovethefigurefromthebattlefield.
COMBAT EXAMPLE 2: BRAWL
An alien creature bursts out from a dark hallway,
and engages one of my crew in a Brawl.
Step 1:
I roll D6 for each of the combatants, and add their
Combat Skill to the roll.The creature has Combat
Skill +1, while my crew member has a +0. I
roll a 4 for the creature, modified to a 5, and the
creature has a Melee weapon (big scary claws),
adding another +2, for a final score of 7. My crew
rolls a 4 as well, +0 for Combat Skill, using a Pistol
that adds +1 for a final score of 5. I lose.The crew
member takes a Hit, and is pushed back 1”.
Step 2:
Checking the damage, I roll D6 for the creature,
getting a 6, adding the Damage value of its claws
(+1) for a a final total of 7. Compared to the crew
member’s Toughness 3, my crew member is toast,
and I remove the figure. If they had a Saving Throw,
I’d make it now.
Step 3:
As they won the Brawl, the alien gets a bonus
move of 2”, no doubt sniffing for more prey.

COMBAT EXAMPLE 3: ENEMY TARGETING
This enemy mercenary is deciding who to shoot at,
and can see three targets:
• A is 8” away and in Cover.
• B is 12” away and in the open.
• C is 15” away and in the open.
Enemies will always try to shoot at the easiest
target to hit. Since the two targets in the open
require a 5+ to Hit, while the target in Cover
requires a 6+, we know the mercenary will fire at
B or C.
If two targets are equally difficult to hit, the closer
target is preferred, so the mercenary will fire on B.

WEAPONS AND GEAR
The following covers a collection of typical
weapons and gear your characters may find
themselves armed with. Note that not all
items may be readily found or purchased.
Some items are included for expanding your
campaign, and for scenario design.
Weapon ranges are condensed. Realistically,
you could fire at far greater distances, but
between the generally poor visibility in
decrepit colony spaceports and industrial
zones, combatants lacking formal training,
and the hasty nature of hip-firing, shorter
ranges better suit Five Parsecs from Home.
And in the space opera films, shows, and
games that inspired the rules, combat takes
place at fairly personal distances!
Weapon Limits
A character may carry 2 weapons, plus a Pistol
class weapon or Blade.
Weapon Ratings
Weapons are rated in three ways:
Range is the longest distance, in tabletop
inches, from which you may attack.
Shots is the number of attack dice (D6) you
get to roll.
Damage is the number added to the damage
roll.
Many weapons have additional traits granting
special rules.

STARSHIPS
Ship Basics
In Five Parsecs From Home, your ship is your
home base. It is your ticket to travel the galaxy,
as well as acting as the area where your crew
membersrelax,hangout,prepare,train,recuperate,
and store their Stash and personal equipment.
While you have a ship,you are a free agent.You
cangowhereyouplease,defyinggalacticpolitics
and Unity boundaries as you see fit.Without
a ship, you’re just so much starport scum,
lingering in the hopes of the next big score.
In the campaign, the ship generally exists in
the background, though it can be affected by
events. Ship-to-ship combat is outside the
scope of these game rules, and you do not
need to buy or construct a ship model, though
committed players may well desire to do so.
Neither will you need detailed floor plans for
the interior. Unless your ship is upgraded,
takes Hull Point damage, or is lost, it doesn’t
tend to influence gameplay.
Ship Damage
Shipscansustaindamagethroughvariousevents.
This is tracked in Hull Points.Damage is never
sustainedtospecificparts,regardlessofthesource.
Each ship has a damage threshold established
when you began the campaign or purchased
the ship. Once that amount of damage has
been accumulated, the ship is a wreck, and no
longer usable. If this happens in space, you
crash on a nearby planet using the rules in
the “being without a ship” section below. If
this happens on the ground, you can reclaim
1D6+5 credits’ worth of scrap parts.
If a ship has Hull Point damage, it cannot
safely leave for another planet, prohibiting
you from traveling during the campaign turn.
Even trivial drive damage can be catastrophic.
Damage is repaired at a rate of 1 Hull Point
per campaign turn, but you can funnel credits
into faster repairs. 1 credit pays off 1 Hull
Point of damage, and any amount can be
repaired this way during a campaign turn.
59
Starships
Emergency Take-off
If you insist on traveling while your ship is
damaged, your ship suffers 3D6 Hull Points
of damage as the drive vents super-heated
plasma throughout the vessel.
Being Without a Ship
If your ship is destroyed while traveling, you
manage to escape in a shuttle and land safely
on a populated world, but your ship is gone.
Additionally, you lose all credits and can only
retain 2 items per crew member. Everything
else is lost in deep space.
While you don’t have a ship, you can’t travel at
will. On the other hand, nothing prevents you
from remaining on a single planet for as long
as you like.
Travel is also possible by purchasing passage
on a commercial vessel.This costs 1 credit
per crew member, and you cannot bring any
packages or cargo you may have been offered
as reward for transporting.
While you lack a ship, you are limited to a
Stash of 5 items.All items are considered to
be of equal “size” for this purpose, though
multiples of a single consumable are
considered to be one item.
Getting a New Ship
Acquiring a new ship is not cheap at all. Each
campaign turn you may look for a new vessel.
Roll 2D6+3 and multiply the total by 10 to
find the cost in credits.
Roll once on the Ship Table in the Character
Creation chapter (p.31).This is the ship on
offer.You may opt to pass and look for a new
ship each campaign turn.
You can finance up to 70 credits of the cost.
Every campaign turn, the amount owed
goes up by +1 credit if you currently owe
30 credits or less, +2 credits if you owe 31
credits or more. If the amount owed exceeds
75 credits, each campaign turn there is a
chance of your ship being seized. Roll 2D6.
On a 2-6, the ship is seized and lost.
Upgrading Your Ship
Your starting ship is assumed to have the
equipment required to perform basic tasks:
jump drives, cargo space, life support,
etc.These components may be rusty and
unreliable, held together with emergency
repairs and best wishes, but they are present,
and allow you to pursue the campaign.
A wealthy crew can install upgraded or
additional Components that offer extra
capabilities or bonuses to actions. Some are
substantial, others are essentially insurance
against mishaps.They represent advantages
for a well-off crew to invest in.
Ship Components
Ship upgrades turn the ship from “a ship” to
“my ship”.These add additional capabilities to
your crew. Some interact with specific events
in the game, while others give you a straight-
forward rules benefit.When you are starting
your campaign, don’t worry about these items
yet.They are intended to be something to
strive towards, and a fully equipped ship will
require a mountain of credits to afford.
Acquiring Components
During the “Purchase Items” stage of the
campaign turn (p.125) you may spend
credits to obtain Ship Components. Only one
Component can be added each turn.When
purchased, the Component is fully functional
at the beginning of the next campaign turn.
You may have acquired Ships’ Parts with a
certain value (see Rewards Table, p.134).
These can be “cashed in” when installing a
Component, reducing the cost by the value of
the part.
Removing Components
If desired, during a campaign turn, you
may remove a single Component from the
60
Starships
ship.You can recoup 1 credit worth of scrap
for every 5 credits’ cost of the installed
Component.This can be done at any time, but
you cannot remove and install a Component
in the same campaign turn.
Fuel Costs
A ship with additional Components will
require more fuel to travel.When traveling
to a new Planet, the cost is increased by +1
credit for every 3 Components installed.

CAMPAIGN PREPARATION
When setting up a campaign, go through the
steps below.We’ve numbered the steps, but
you can shuffle the order (in this section only)
if you prefer.
1. Select Crew Size
The default campaign crew size is 6 crew
members.This is both the starting crew size
as well as the maximum number of characters
you can bring on a mission.
If you prefer a smaller game, you may set the
campaign crew size to 5 or even 4.This affects
your starting crew size and the maximum
number of characters you may deploy in
a battle. Players can always opt (and are
sometimes forced) to bring fewer characters to
a battle, but enemy number is always based
on the campaign crew size, as shown below:
Crew Size 6
• Begin the game with 6 characters.
• You may deploy up to 6 characters in
battle.
• When determining enemy numbers you
will fight, roll 2D6 and use the higher
result of the two dice.

GAME CURRENCIES
Credits
A generic Unity-backed form of monetary unit,
credits are accepted virtually everywhere,
and can be traded for most goods. Likewise, a
complex system of barter is in place allowing all
manner of unlikely items to be traded from one
cornerof thegalaxytotheother.Inthecampaign
game, we simplify this all into the credit.
Credits are accumulated in a single pool for
your crew, accessible by any crew member
at any time.You do not need to track what
money each character is carrying, and credits
are never lost due to casualties.
If anything is worth less than 1 credit, then it
is assumed to be irrelevant to the campaign
game.Your crew may have any number of
martini glasses, holo-stims, and fancy cigars.
Experience Points
Characters progress in the game by various
methods – by acquiring better ships, better
weapons, better equipment – but also by
earning Experience Points (XP) from events
and completing missions. Unlike the crew’s
Stash of equipment or credits, which may be
shared between crew members, you track XP
for each character’s XP individually.When they
have enough, they will be able to spend them
to buy Character Upgrades, which increase
that character’s statistics.
Quest Rumors
You may obtain Quest Rumors (also referred
to simply as Rumors) in the campaign, as well
as during character creation.You should also
track Rumors as a single pool for the whole
crew. Each campaign turn you will roll to see if
the Rumors lead to a Quest. If your crew is on
an active Quest, any new Rumors you obtain
will help towards resolution of the Quest you
are currently on.
For flavor, roll D10 to determine what nature
the Rumor takes.This does not affect gameplay.
ROLL RUMOR IS
1-2 An extracted data file
3-4 Notebook with secret information
5-6 Old map showing a location
7-8 A tip from a contact
9-10 An intercepted transmission
MAIN RULES
Crew Size 5
• Begin the game with 5 characters.
• Youmaydeployupto5charactersinbattle.
• When determining enemy numbers you
will fight, roll 1D6.
Crew Size 4
• Begin the game with 4 characters.
• Youmaydeployupto4charactersinbattle.
• When determining enemy numbers you
will fight, roll 2D6 and use the lower
result of the two dice.
Note that regardless of the selected crew size,
you can end up with any number of characters
on your crew roster as you play the campaign.
You are only limited in how many you can
bring to a battle.
2. Decide Whether to Use the Story Track
We have included a narrative set of events
that stack on top of the regular campaign,
as detailed in the Story Track appendix (see
p.153). If you wish to use these, decide now.
3. Select a Victory Condition
Campaigns may potentially go on indefinitely.
You may also opt to use the Story Track to add
a narrative story to the campaign play (p.68). If
you like to have a distinct goal in sight, select
a Victory Condition now.
Note that some of these goals are intentionally
quite a grind,and some are heavily luck-based.
• Play 20 campaign turns
• Play 50 campaign turns
• Play 100 campaign turns
• Complete 3 Quests
• Complete 5 Quests
• Complete 10 Quests
• Win 20 tabletop battles		
• Win 50 tabletop battles
• Win 100 tabletop battles
• Kill 10 Unique Individuals
• Kill 25 Unique Individuals
• Upgrade a single character 10 times
• Upgrade 3 characters 10 times
• Upgrade 5 characters 10 times
• Play50campaignturnsinChallengingmode
• Play 50 campaign turns in Hardcore mode
• Play 50 campaign turns in Insanity mode
For Character Upgrade Victory Conditions, the
characters do not have to be in the crew at the
same time. If one character Upgrades 10 times
and dies, all 10 Character Upgrades still count.
If you select a Victory Condition, it cannot
be changed, and you can only achieve that
selected condition, even if you would qualify
for others.You cannot add a Victory Condition
once a campaign has been started.
Selecting and completing a Victory Condition
awards an Elite Rank (see p.65), which grants
additionalbenefitstonewcampaigns.EachVictory
Condition can only award an Elite Rank once.
4. Select a Difficulty Mode
If you prefer an easier or more difficult
experience, you may choose to play on an
alternative difficulty mode.
Easy
• After every battle, select a crew member
to receive +1 XP.
• Increase post-battle rewards by +1 credit.
• When setting up a tabletop battle, if you
would face 5+ opponents, remove one
Basic enemy.
• Only the Play 20 campaign turns
and Win 20 tabletop battles Victory
Conditions can be completed in the Easy
difficulty mode.

event would grant them, it has no effect,
and the item or event is not rerolled.
• Good luck!
5. Establish House Rules
Finally, evaluate whether you want to make
any house rules. If this is your first time
playing, I strongly encourage you to play the
rules as written. Once you understand how
everything works, go ahead and tear the
system to pieces, then put the pieces back
together any way you would like. In most
cases, it is best to not add, remove, or change
a house rule mid-campaign.
Elite Ranks
If you have finished a campaign after
achieving a Victory Condition, you will
earn an Elite Rank.Elite Ranks carry over
between campaigns.They are earned by
youasaplayerasamarkof achievement.
When beginning a new campaign, you
receive benefits as indicated below.
• One bonus story point per Elite
Rank.
• Receive 2 XP per Elite Rank,
which may be assigned to any
characters you like, resolving
any Character Upgrades
immediately. Note that the
Victory Conditions based on
Upgrading 10 times must be
achieved within one campaign.
Pre-campaign Character
Upgrades do not carry over for
the purposes of this count.

• For every 5 Elite Ranks, you
may pick one “Stars of the Story”
option that can be used twice
(see p.67).You must pick when
setting up the campaign.
You can potentially earn 17 Elite
Ranks, though doing so would be a
monumental amount of dedication.
If you genuinely do this without
cheating, let us know!

Campaign Preparation
STORY POINTS
Story points are a powerful resource used to
adjust things in your favor, give you a lucky
break, or just tweak the story to work better.
In each case you should create a narrative
explanation for how the altered outcome
came to pass.
• Before rolling on any table outside
combat, you may spend 1 story point to
roll twice and pick the result you prefer.
• Any time an item, character ability, or
similar requires a die roll to work and
fails, you may spend 1 story point to
have it succeed after all.
• Any time you have rolled for anything,
you may spend 1 story point to roll
again, but the new result must be
accepted.This works whether you are
rolling for your own characters, an
enemy action, or something that just
happens in the campaign.
• You may spend 1 story point to obtain
3 credits for the crew.This can only be
used once per campaign turn.
• You may spend 1 story point to obtain
+3 XP for any one character.This can
only be used once per campaign turn.
• You may spend 1 story point to take an
additional campaign action with any
crew member.This can only be used
once per campaign turn.
Starting the Campaign
When creating a new campaign, begin the
game with 1D6+1 story points.These cannot
be used during the character creation process
of your initial crew.
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is
Hardcore, subtract 1.
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is
Insanity, the option is not used.You
start with no story points and can never
receive them.
• If this is your first time playing Five
Story Points
Parsecs from Home, or you are teaching
the game to a new player, go ahead and
roll twice and pick the better score.
• If you already own copies of Five
Parsecs, Five Klicks,AND Five Leagues,
go ahead and add +1 to the total.
Your Reputation Develops
At the start of every third campaign turn, add
+1 story point.
A Bitter Day
If you Hold the Field after a battle, but one of
your characters is killed, add +1 story point.
THE STARS OF THE STORY
Five Parsecs from Home uses an unusual
amount of randomized procedural generation.
To put it another way, dice get involved a lot.
This has potential to create an unusual streak
of luck (or disaster) at the whim of the dice.
You might have multiple easy encounters
only to be demolished by three fights against
assassins in a row. Maybe you can’t find new
weapons to save your life… literally. Maybe
your entire crew ends up dead.
Sometimes story points just aren’t enough.
Some players are going to relish going into an
overwhelming fight with one crew member,
armed with a handgun, a confident attitude,
and a pack of gum. Others will feel dejected
that the dice just ended their campaign.
How you feel about things depends on your
attitude to games, but here are some options
for when the dice start to go against you.You
may employ each ONCE per campaign.
Write each option on a separate index card
and when an option has been used, remove
it for the rest of the campaign, however
long it lasts.To gain new uses, you have
to start completely from scratch, or have
accomplished 5 Elite Ranks (see p.65)
If this sort of thing doesn’t feel grim and gritty
enough for your style of campaign, feel free to
ignore it.Note that if your campaign’s difficulty
mode is Insanity (see p.65), these options are
NOT available.You are on your own!
• It’s time to go! Thecrewmayimmediately
end a battle,with all remaining characters
escaping from the fight.
• Looked worse than it was! Ignore a
roll on the Injury Table.The character
recovers immediately.
• Did you ever meet my mate? Add a
new character to your team immediately,
even mid-battle. Place the model within
6” of any battlefield edge.They can act
immediately.
• Lucky shot! If a character just missed a
shot, turn it into a hit. Only applies to
a single shot, even if the weapon rolls
multiple attack dice.
• Rainy day fund! Immediately add
1D6+5 credits to your available funds.

The Stars of the Story
THE CAMPAIGN TURN
Five Parsecs from Home is played in a series
of campaign turns.Think of a campaign turn
as an episode in a television show, with each
turn representing a few days, weeks, or even
months of action. Each campaign turn is
played by going through the steps shown in
the table below.
At the heart of each campaign turn is a
tabletop battle, though quite a few other
things will take place around it.The next
three chapters cover the steps you need to go
through before, during, and after that battle.
Before you are ready for battle you need to
determine what world you are on and whether
you are going to travel, for which you consult
the Travel steps (p.69). If you are starting the
campaign, and you want to generate some
random factors, you may optionally choose
the New World Arrival steps (p.72), but if you
prefer to begin on a world with no special
rules, you can skip this step for the first world.
If you are staying where you are, or you just
arrived here, consult the World steps (p.76).
After the Tabletop Battle (p.87), go through
the Post-Battle Sequence (p.119), when the
consequences and rewards from the battle
come into focus, before beginning the next
campaign turn.
STEP 1: TRAVEL (P.69)
1. Flee Invasion (if applicable)
2. Decide whether to travel
3. Starship travel event (if applicable)
4. New world arrival steps (if applicable)
STEP 2: WORLD (P.76)
1. Upkeep and ship repairs
2.Assign and resolve crew tasks
3. Determine job offers
4.Assign equipment
5. Resolve any Rumors
6. Choose your battle
STEP 3: TABLETOP BATTLE (P.87)
STEP 4: POST-BATTLE SEQUENCE
(P.119)
1. Resolve Rival status
2. Resolve Patron status
3. Determine Quest progress
4. Get paid
5. Battlefield finds
6. Check for Invasion
7. Gather the Loot
8. Determine Injuries and recovery
9. Experience and Character Upgrades
10. Invest in Advanced Training
11. Purchase items
12. Roll for a Campaign Event
13. Roll for a Character Event
14. Check for Galactic War progress

The Campaign Turn
TRAVEL STEPS
Flee Invasion
Sometimes war comes to even peaceful
planets… and you don’t want to get caught
in the middle of it. If previous campaign play
has told you this world is being Invaded, you
must attempt to flee. Roll 2D6.A score of 8+
is required to get safely off-world.
• If the roll fails, there’s no time during
your World step to do anything except
Assign Equipment (p.85) before
proceeding to the “Battle” section of the
rules, where you MUST fight an Invasion
Battle (p.92).
• If you make the roll, or if you survive
the Invasion Battle, you make it off
the world and travel to a new planet,
following the usual steps. No payment,
purchases, or Campaign Events take
place while you flee, but you may roll up
a Character Event (p.126).
• If you don’t have the 5 credits needed
for fuel, you can sell off gear at a loss
(receiving 1 credit per two items
sold), or abandon the ship and take
evacuation passage, as below.
• If you lack a ship, you flee on an
evacuation ship.You lose all credits
you do have, plus 1D6 items from your
Stash and equipment (chosen by you),
used to pay for bribes, losses, and things
left behind.
Regardless of how you leave, all Rivals,
Patrons, and other people known to your crew
on this world are lost.You’re not the only ones
who needed to relocate in a hurry.
Decide Whether to Travel
Each campaign turn takes place in a single
star system.At the beginning of a turn, you
may always decide to leave behind the current
planet.This essentially allows you a fresh start
on a new world, which may be beneficial if
you’ve made a lot of people angry.
If you have a ship, it costs 5 credits (fuel and
other costs) to travel to a new world. If you do
not have the money, you are stuck until you
do. If you do opt to travel, roll once on the
Starship Travel Events Table below.
Crews without a ship may pay for commercial
passage at a cost of 1 credit per crew member.
You cannot carry any packages or other
deliverable cargo while doing so, but may
bring all of your personal belongings.When
traveling commercially, do not roll for Starship
Travel Events.
Traveling does not “take time” in the
campaign. Injured characters do not recover
while traveling, for example, unless indicated
by a specific event.
Note that you may roll up the characteristics
of a new world, but can opt not to travel to
it. If so, you must wait until next campaign
turn to plot a course for a new system or, if
you don’t have a ship, see if a shuttle is going
somewhere more pleasant.
You may opt to return to a world you’ve played
on before, reinstating all Patrons and Rivals
that were left behind, so if you would consider
returning to a world, keep a record of it on the
World Record Sheet at the back of these rules,
which can also be downloaded from www.
modiphius.net
Traveling in a Damaged Ship
If your ship has sustained Hull damage, leaving
is dangerous. Consult the “Your Starship” chapter
(p.59) for details.
69
Travel Steps
Starship Travel Events Table
Roll D100 and apply the event listed. In some rare cases, an event may not line up well with the
ongoing story. If so, you can often change the narration of what is happening, while retaining the
mechanical effects.
Several events cause the loss of ship Hull Points.This affects your ability to take off from planets,
as discussed on page 59.
ROLL EVENT
1-7 Asteroids
Rocky debris everywhere, maybe from a recent collision? If you wish to avoid it, roll 1D6,
requiring a 5+ to chart a safe path. If successful, roll again on this table.
To go through the field, select a crew member and roll 1D6+Savvy three times, requiring a 4+
to succeed each time.
Each failed roll inflicts 1D6 Hull Point damage to the ship.
8-12 Navigation trouble
Is this place even on the star maps? Lose 1 story point as you drift through empty space, then
roll again on this table.
If your ship is currently suffering from Hull Point damage, and you roll this event, a random
crew member must roll on the Injury Table, as system failures cause life support malfunctions
across the vessel.
13-17 Raided
Your vessel catches the eye of some pirates. Intimidation might work: Select a crew member
and roll 1D6+Savvy.A 6+ is required to avoid conflict.
Otherwise, set up a battle in cramped territory, using the Criminal Elements Encounter Table
(p.94). Enemy numbers are determined by rolling 3D6, picking the highest die (with campaign
crew size 5, roll 2D6 and pick highest; with campaign crew size 4, roll 1D6).Add the numbers
indicated in the enemy table, +1 extra figure.
There is no objective. If you drive them off, they flee back to their ship. If you lose, you lose all
credits and everything in your Stash, though you can keep the ship.
If you win, you get the normal rewards for winning an Opportunity mission (see p.120), plus a
bonus roll on the Loot Table (p.131).
Note that this battle is an ‘out of sequence’ encounter, and does not count as the main Battle
stage for the campaign turn.
18-25 Deep space wreckage
You find an old wreck drifting through empty space. Scanning it, you get 2 rolls on the Gear
Subtable (p.132). Both items are damaged and need to be Repaired.
26-29 Drive trouble
It’s not supposed to make that sound.
Select 3 crew members and have each roll 1D6+Savvy.
A 6+ is required for success. For each failure, you are grounded on the next world for one
campaign turn while the drive is reset.Taking off before the drive is reset inflicts 2D6 Hull Point
damage to the ship.
70
Travel Steps
ROLL EVENT
30-38 Down-time
It’s a long time to just sit here.
Select a crew member of choice and add +1 XP.The crew has time to do maintenance tasks,
and can Repair 1 damaged item with no roll required.
39-44 Distress call
“This is Licensed Trader Cyberwolf”.
If you come to their aid, roll 1D6.
1: The ship’s drive must have detonated moments after you received the signal.Your ship is
struck by a wave of debris as you approach, suffering 1D6+1 Hull Point damage.
2: You only find drifting wreckage.
3-4: You can rescue a crew member.Treat this as the Escape Pod event.
5-6: You arrive in time to help save the ship from a drive malfunction. Select a crew member
and roll 1D6+Savvy.A 7+ is required to succeed, but you may make three attempts. If you
succeed, the jubilant crew give you a bunch of stuff. Roll three times on the gear loot table. If
you fail, the drive detonates, and your ship is damaged as if you had rolled a 1 on this subtable.
45-50 Patrol ship
A Unity patrol vessel hails you.
Roll 1D6-3 twice. Each die that scores above a 0 results in that number of items being
confiscated as contraband.You can give them any items carried or in your Stash. Due to the
military presence, the next world you visit cannot be Invaded.
51-53 Cosmic phenomenon
A crew member sees a strange manifestation in space.When they ask around, nobody else saw
anything, and the ship’s computers confirm nothing was there.
The crew member adds +1 Luck (if they are able).This event can only ever happen once in a
campaign.Treat as nothing happening, if it happens again.
If you have a Precursor in the crew, they predict it’s a good omen.Add +1 story point as well.
54-60 Escape pod
You find an escape pod drifting through space. If you opt to rescue them, roll 1D6.
1: They’re a wanted criminal. If you let them go when you arrive on the next world, they might
do you a favor later.The next time you make a new Rival, roll 4+ on 1D6 to immediately
remove the Rivals from the campaign. If you turn them in, claim 1D6 credits, but get a Rival
from their old gang.
2-3: They reward you with 1D3 credits and a roll on the Loot Table when you arrive on the
nearest world.
4: They have nothing to pay you with, but do have some interesting information.Add 1 Quest
Rumor and 1 story point.
5: They are willing to join your crew. Roll up a new character, but they come with no equipment
at all. If you don’t want to hire them, they just leave at the next world.
6: As entry 5, but the character begins play with 10 XP as yet unspent.
61-66 Accident
A crew member gets Injured while doing a routine maintenance task.They must rest up for one
campaign turn to recover from the Injury, and one item they carry is damaged.
71
Travel Steps
NEW WORLD ARRIVAL STEPS
When starting a campaign, skip steps 1 and 2.
1. Check for Rivals
Any Rivals you have will roll 1D6.On a 5+,
they opt to follow you,otherwise they remain
behind.
2. Dismiss Patrons
AllPatronsremainbehindunlesstheyare
Persistent.
3. Check for Licensing Requirements
Roll 1D6. On a 5-6 the world requires a
Freelancer License to perform Patron jobs:
Roll a further 1D6 to determine how many
credits this will cost. Once purchased, it
remains in effect for perpetuity, even if you
return to the world later on.
You may attempt to obtain a forged License.
Select a crew member and roll 1D6+Savvy.
If the score is a 6+, you obtain a License for
free. If the roll is a 1 before modifiers, you
must add a Rival on this world, as local law
enforcement, crime bosses, or business cartels
take a dim view of your actions. Only one
attempt is permitted.
4. World Traits
Roll D100 on the following table to determine
what trait applies to the world.Any visibility
restrictions are rolled at the start of each
campaign turn. If scenario conditions would
apply a second visibility restriction, apply the
shortest.
ROLL EVENT
67-75 Travel-time
Local conditions force you to jump to the very edge of the system and approach under standard
drives.Any Injured crew may rest for one campaign turn.
76-85 Uneventful trip
A lot of time playing cards and cleaning guns.
You can Repair one damaged item.
86-91 Time to reflect
How is the story unfolding? What did it all mean?
Add +1 story point.
92-95 Time to read a book
There’s time to sit, have a read, and maybe even indulge in a bit of education.
Roll 1D6. On a 1-2, a random crew member earns +3 XP. On a 3-4, a random crew member
earns +2 XP and a second random crew member earns +1 XP. On a 5-6, three random crew
each earn +1 XP.
96-100 Locked in the library data by night
Pouring over old records and fragments of data, the captain has unearthed some intriguing
information about the sector of space you are heading into.
You can roll up the planetary info (problems, conveniences, licensing requirements) for three
worlds and select which you wish to visit, but due to fuel limitations, you must visit one of the
three generated.All three generated worlds remain in the campaign, and can be visited later.

1. Upkeep and Ship Repairs
Each campaign turn, you must pay Upkeep
for your crew, representing pay checks, booze,
food, anything else that is more routine than
adventure. Upkeep costs 1 credit if you have
4-6 crew, +1 additional credit per crew
member past 6.
Example:
A crew of 5 pay 1 credit.A crew of 8 would pay
2 additional credits (for a total of 3)
Alternatively, you may sell equipment to pay
Upkeep. For each item sold, you gain 1 credit
worth of Upkeep.
For each credit you are short, one crew
member will refuse to do any jobs for you this
campaign turn.You do not have to count crew
members in Sick Bay towards the Upkeep cost.
You can opt to kick out any crew member at
this stage. If you do, you may pick one item
they carry and return it to your Stash, but they
take the rest of their equipment with them.
Ship Debt
You can make payments on your ship, if
you owe money. Having done so (or having
declined to do so), if you still owe money on
your ship, the amount is now increased by
1 credit (2 credits if you owe 31 credits or
more). If this brings the total to 75 credits
or more, roll 2D6. On a 2-6, your ship has
been seized by the authorities or the shady
people you owe the money to, and is lost
permanently.
Ships Repairs
If your ship has sustained Hull Point
damage,you may repair 1 point automatically
at this stage.You may also spend money
restoring Hull Points. Every credit spent on
repairs will fix 1 point of damage.You may
spend any amount of credits you like.
Pay for Medical Care
If you have crew in Sick Bay, you may now pay
4 credits to remove 1 campaign turn from a
single character’s recovery time.This can be
done as often as you can afford it,thanks to the
wonders of modern medicine. Repair times
for Bot characters can be sped up through the
same process, and at the same cost.
Characters in Sick Bay and Bots needing
repairs now mark off one campaign turn
from their duration. If this was their last
campaign turn in Sick Bay, they can rejoin the
crew for battle, but cannot perform a task this
campaign turn (see below).
2. Assign and Resolve Crew Tasks
Every campaign turn, each crew member can
engage in one task, including looking for
new crew members or Patrons, covering the
crew’s trail from Rivals or actively tracking
them, exploring, training, trading, or repairing
broken items. Each crew member that isn’t in
Sick Bay can take on a task now.
You may assign up to two characters to any
one task.A character may opt to simply sit
around on the ship and do nothing, if desired.
Available tasks are:
Find a
Patron
Go look for someone to hire the crew.
Train Go to the gun range and the gym.
Trade Try to score some new equipment.
Recruit Expand your crew.
Explore See the sights around town.
Track Look for a Rival for a showdown.
Repair
your Kit
Try to fix broken items.
Decoy Help avoid Rivals finding you.

World Steps
Find a Patron
To find a Patron, roll 1D6 and add the number
of crew members who are looking. If the crew
has an old Patron among their contacts, each
Patron adds +1 to the roll.After rolling, you
may opt to spend credits. Each credit earns a
+1 bonus.
• If the result is a 5 or higher, you’ve
found a Patron to hire you for a job (see
p.83).
• If the result is a 6 or higher, you’ve
found two, and may choose either job.
If you have an existing Patron, the first job
offer is from them. If two jobs are offered, one
will be a random, existing Patron, the other
will be from a new Patron.After generating all
job details, you may opt to turn the job down
if you end up not liking it.
Train
Characters can improve their ability scores
with Experience Points.This often happens as
a reward in the Post-battle stage of the game,
But characters can also Train as a task, earning
1XP. If this means they may make a Character
Rivals
As you play the campaign,opponents you fight will
often hold a grudge for interfering with their plans.
This turns them into a Rival in your campaign.
Once a Rival has been established, they will
launch attacks on you in an attempt to get revenge,
potentially interfering with missions you are
attempting to undertake.You will have to decide
whether to try and track them down to settle the
score for good, or whether to flee the planet.
Patrons
Space is big and there’s always someone who
needs something to be done.While many
missions represent doing a favor for the locals
in return for a few Credits and a hot meal, an
employer with a more demanding mission and
better pay is known as a Patron.They may be local
government organizations,mega-corporations,
or secretive individuals.Doing jobs for Patrons
allows you to obtain additional benefits and pay,
but the demands are often steep.

World Steps
Upgrade (see “Experience and Character
Upgrades”, p.123), resolve that immediately.
Trade
For each crew member Trading, roll once
on the Trade Table (see p.79) to see what
presents itself.You can get additional rolls by
spending 3 credits each.At least one crew
member must be Trading to permit this
expenditure.
Recruit
If your crew has fewer than 6 members
currently, you can automatically recruit a
new character for each crew member sent
Recruiting (until you are back to 6 members).
If you have 6 or more crew members, roll a
D6, adding the number of crew members sent
to recruit.A score of 6 or higher allows a new
recruit to be added.
Each recruit rolls using the random method
in the character creation process (see p.14).
Recruits have the basic profile for their type,
and come armed with a Handgun.They do not
roll on any of the random background tables
in the “Character Creation” chapter.
Explore
Each crew member exploring rolls once on the
Exploration Table (see p.80).
Track
If you have Rivals, you can attempt to Track
some of them down. Roll 1D6, adding the
number of crew that are Tracking. If the result
is a 6 or higher, you have located a Rival of
your choice, allowing you to fight a battle
against them this campaign turn.You may
spend credits beforehand to obtain a +1
bonus per credit to the roll.
Repair Your Kit
If you have had items destroyed, you can
attempt to Repair them. Roll 1D6 and add the
Savvy ability score of the character doing this
job.Add +1 if the character is an Engineer.
You may spend credits on spare parts. Every 1
credit spent before the roll grants a +1 bonus.
• On a 6+, the item is repaired and is
usable again.
• A natural 1 always fails and means the
item is beyond fixing.
Decoy
When rolling to see if Rivals track you down,
add +1 to the roll for every crew member sent
to act as a Decoy.

4. Assign Equipment
At this stage, you can reassign any equipment
for your crew. Characters can trade items,
leave items in your Stash, or take items from
the Stash.Your Stash has unlimited space if
you have a ship. If you do not, you are limited
to only 5 items Stashed at any given time,
though duplicates of consumable items all
count as a single item.
Stashed items are not available during a
battle. Once assignments are complete, each
character is equipped with their assigned
items until the following campaign turn
begins.This means that what they have now is
what they will take into battle.
5. Resolve any Rumors
You may find Rumors as you play. If you are
not currently on a Quest, roll a D6 at this
stage. If the roll is equal or below the number
of Rumors, remove all Rumors from your
roster.You have now received a Quest which
you may pursue immediately. Until the Quest
is resolved, any time you would receive a
Rumor, you receive a Quest Rumor instead
(p.120).
6. Choose Your Battle
Check for Rivals
First, you must check that your Rivals give you
the opportunity to choose your battle! Tally up
the number of Rivals you have, and roll a D6.
If the roll is equal to or lower than the number
of Rivals, one of them has tracked you down,
and you will have to fight them.This will
prevent you from doing whatever you had
wanted to do this campaign turn. Quests and
Rumors remain, but a Patron job will fail if the
time to complete it has expired.
Select the exact Rival at random from those
on your list.
Select Your Job
If you are not attacked by Rivals, you may
select from any ONE of the options below, if
they are available.
OPTION AVAILABILITY
Carry out an
Opportunity mission
Always available
Attack a Rival If you Tracked them
successfully
Continue a Quest If you have an active
Quest
Carry out a Patron
job
If you have an active
Patron
Next, proceed to the “Battle” section of the
rules and fight out a tabletop battle.You may
select no more than 6 crew members to bring
into a battle.The rest will wait behind on the
ship. If you have selected a campaign crew
size of 4 or 5, then that number is also the
maximum number of crew you can bring.You
may always opt to bring fewer crew members
than you are entitled to, though you receive
no special adjustments or bonuses for doing
so. However, it may be worth considering if
you have a character you would rather not risk
in combat.

World Steps
CAMPAIGN TURN EXAMPLE
Step 1:
Since I am just starting out,I decide to skip the
Travel Phase.We don’t have a real reason to go
anywhere.WhileIcouldskipworldcreationforthe
startingplace,IfigureImightaswellbesomewhere
interesting and use New World Arrival.
The first roll is to see if I need a License to do
Patron jobs. I roll a 3, which means I do not.
Next, I roll for a World Trait and score a 23: The
starport has many skilled technicians, so I’ll get
a +1 bonus whenever I try to get something
repaired.
Step 2:
The first step for my crew is then Upkeep. Gotta
keep everyone fed and paid! With a 6 character
crew, Upkeep is 1 credit, so I mark that off
(leaving me with 16).
I decide to spend 4 credits paying down the
debt on my ship to 21 credits (22 credits after
interest, the gougers!)
I don’t have anyone in Sick Bay (yet) so we
don’t have to worry about medical care.That
means I can send my crew out to do things
around town.
Looking at the list, I decide Shi will look for a
Patron, Flint will Train,Twitch and Simon will
Explore the starport, and Nada will act as a
Decoy, while Tank does a bit of Trading.
• Shi’s Patron search is a 1D6 roll adding
+3 (one crew figure and two prior
Patrons).
I roll a 2 for a total of 5. I’ve found a new
Patron.
• Flint studies hard and receives 1 XP.
• Twitch and Simon both roll on the
Exploration Table. I roll a 14 for Twitch,
who has a fun chatting with one of the
locals. I get to roll 1D6+Savvy with a 5+
earning a story point. No luck, though.
I guess she was just flirting a bit. I roll a
73 for Simon on the Exploration Table,
and a hot tip leads us to a potentially
well-paid job.This is worth 3 credits
extra, if we do an Opportunity mission
this campaign turn.
• I roll a 49 for Tank on the Trade Table
and he scores us 3 credits worth of
starship fuel. Cool.
With everything accounted for, let’s see what
that Patron job is all about. Rolling on the Job
Offers Table, we learn it’s a Sector Government
job, and pays 1 credit extra. It must be done
this campaign turn, and has no Benefits,
Hazards, or Conditions. Fair.
Next,I canAssign Equipment,but we didn’t find
anythingnew.Ialsodon’thaveanyQuestRumors,
so no chance of us finding anything there.
Step 3:
It’s time to go do something. I could take the
Patron (Sector Government) job, but in this
case doing the Opportunity mission is more
profitable due to that tip we got, so that’s the
goal.As the Patron job had to be done this
campaign turn, it won’t be available again.
We have Rivals out for our blood, so I roll
1D6, adding +1 as Nada acted as a Decoy.The
modified roll is a 5,easily dodging our Rivals.
If I’d rolled a 1 or 2 (the number of Rivals we
have) we would have had to fight one of them
instead.

Campaign Turn Example
READYING FOR BATTLE
From the Fringe to the Core Worlds, Unified
Space is full of conflict. Sector-wide land
grabs, hardline legal enforcement, petty local
squabbles, or generation-old slights seeking
final justice, sooner or later everybody’s
reaching for a weapon.And there’s you, in the
middle of it.
This chapter takes you through the Battle
stage of the game, from calculating who and
how many enemies you face, to running away,
with all the opportunities for glory in between.
Battles fall into the following types:
• Patron missions
• Rival missions
• Quest missions
• Opportunity missions
• Invasion battles
From the campaign turn sequence (p.68),
you will know what type of mission to play. If
nothing else presented itself, you will always
do an Opportunity mission.

2. Determine the Objective
Opportunity, Patron and Quest missions will
roll for the objective you are undertaking. If
this is the final battle of a Quest, it is always a
Fight Off objective, and you must add +1 to
the number of enemy faced.To Win the battle,
you must achieve the objective (even if you
are subsequently chased from the battlefield,
unless the specific mission objective states
otherwise).

Types of Objective
Access
You must reach a computer console in the
exact center of the battlefield. Once there,
you must gain access.This requires a roll of
1D6+Savvy, scoring a 6+.A Combat Action
is required for each attempt, but up to two
characters can make the attempt every round.
Soulless crew can attempt it while being
within 6”. Engineer or Bot crew can add an
extra +1 to the roll.
Rolling a natural 1 means the system is
hardened against intrusion. Rolling a second
natural 1 for access during the battle means
the mission is a failure, as the system locks up.
Engineers (only) ignore any natural 1s.
Once accessed, you Win the mission. If you
drive off all enemies, you must still roll to gain
access, but you can use any remaining crew
member.
Acquire
An item needed for the Quest is placed at the
center of the table.A crew member must move
into contact, take a Combat Action, and then
move off the table.
If the carrier becomes a casualty, roll 1D6: On
a 1, the item is destroyed. Otherwise it can be
picked up by spending a Combat Action at the
location they fell.
If you drive off the enemy, you can pick up the
item at your own leisure.
Defend
Your objective is to drive off the enemy.To
Win, you must Hold the Field.
• If the opposing AI is normally Cautious,
Defensive, or Tactical, change it to
Aggressive.
• Add +1 when determining the enemy
numbers.
Deliver
A crew member of your choosing is carrying a
package.The package must be delivered to the
exact center of the table.A suitable marker or
terrain feature should be placed there. Placing
the package safely requires a Combat Action.
If the carrier becomes a casualty, roll 1D6: On
a 1, the item is destroyed. Otherwise it can be
picked up by spending a Combat Action at the
location they fell.
If you drive off all enemies, you Win as long as
the package is undamaged.
Eliminate
Select a random enemy figure.They are the
target. If they are killed, you Win the mission.
If the target would Bail from the battle
(see p.114), put a marker next to them and
leave them in place. For the next round, the
target cannot move, but may shoot and fight
normally. If you fail to kill them in this final
round, they make good their escape, and the
mission has failed.
Fight Off
There is no objective other than driving off the
enemy.To Win, you must Hold the Field.
Move Through
You Win the mission if at least 2 crew
members move off the opposing battlefield
edge. If you drive off all enemies, you Win
as long as you have at least 2 crew members
remaining.
Patrol
Tally up the number of large terrain features
(or equivalent clustered features) on the table
and, using a suitable die, select 3 of them at
random. During the battle, a crew member
must end a move within 2” of each feature.
Once all 3 have been checked, you Win. If you
drive off the enemy you can, of course, do this
at your leisure.

Readying For Battle
Protect
You will be accompanied by a VIP character
(Reactions 1 / 4” / +0 / 3).They are unarmed
and may never initiate a Brawl, but will defend
normally.They cannot be given any equipment.
The VIP must set up at least 12” from the
center of the table.The enemy must set up
12” from the center on their side.Treat the VIP
as another member of your crew.
If the VIP spends a full round within 3” of the
center of the table, you Win. If you achieve
this within the first 4 rounds of the game, you
earn an additional 2 credits in pay.
Secure
You must end 2 consecutive rounds with
crew within 2” of the center of the table.A
crew member with an enemy within 6” of
them does not count. Once this is achieved,
you Win. If you drive off the opposition, you
can complete the objective at your leisure.
Search
Put a token on each medium or large terrain
feature.A character in contact with, inside,
or on the feature may search it as a Combat
Action. Roll 1D6.A 5+ finds what you were
looking for, and you Win. If the roll fails
at every location, the item is not on the
battlefield, and the mission cannot be Won.
If you drive the enemy away, simply add up
the remaining features and roll the dice all at
once to see if the item was here.
Rival Attacks
If you are being attacked by a Rival, roll below
to determine the circumstances. If you tracked
them down, you will always fight a Showdown
(see below).
There is no Win condition against Rivals, but
if you Hold the Field, you have an increased
chance of permanently chasing them off.
If you flee from the battle before 4 rounds are
up, a random crew member will lose a random
item of equipment carried in your flight.

Raid
If you fail to Hold the Field, your ship will take
1D6+1 points of Hull Point damage. If you
have a spaceship model, it should be placed
dramatically on the table for this mission so
that you have a visual reminder of what you
are defending!
Invasion Battles
If you are defending against an Invasion
battle, you are simply here to outlast the
attacking forces as the war rages all around
you. Invasion opponents always have two
additional enemies.You must hold out for
6 rounds, then you can flee or fight until you
Hold the Field.There is no Win condition.Any
figure that leaves the table before Round 6
becomes a casualty.
3. Determine the Enemy
If you are fighting a Rival mission or Invasion
battle, you will usually know who you are
fighting. Pick the most appropriate entry from
the encounter tables presented in this chapter
(see pp.94-103). If you are not sure, or have
acquired an unexpected Rival, roll twice and
pick the more interesting or appropriate. Once
a Rival has been established, they will always
be the same type.
Otherwise, you will need to generate the
opposition for the mission you are about to
undertake. First, roll D100 on the Enemy
Encounter Category Table, then go to the
appropriate subtable and roll D100 again.
This will give you the exact type of enemy.The
tables provides all of the ability scores needed
to run the enemy in a battle, along with any
special rules that apply to the encounter.

The AI Type column indicates the type of AI
to use:

B Beast
Number of Opponents
The number of opponents you will face is
affected by the campaign crew size you have
chosen, by the size of your crew in the field,
and by the campaign difficulty.
• For a campaign crew size of 6, roll two
D6 and pick the higher result.This is
the number of opponents.
• If you opted to play the campaign with
a crew size of 5, roll one D6 for the
number of opponents.
• If you opted to play with a crew size of 4,
roll two 2D6 and select the lower result.
Optional Rules:
Custom Enemy Tables
If you have a strong story going on,
you may find that some foes are more
or less appropriate to your campaign.
If so, remove up to three entries on
each enemy table, and then fill the
vacant slots with duplicates of any
existing enemy type.
92
Readying For Battle
Add the modifier listed under Numbers in
the Enemy Table (p.94).The modified total is
the number of opposing figures you will be
fighting. Modify this, based on the size of your
crew in the field. If you are fielding a crew of
2 or more figures below the standard size for
your campaign (typically 6), subtract 1 from
the enemy numbers.
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is Easy,
and if the total number of opponents
would be 5+ at this stage, remove 1
regular opponent.
• If the campaign's difficulty mode is
Challenging or above, and if either
of the dice rolled a 1 or 2, reroll them
before selecting the highest die.
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is
Hardcore or Insanity, add +1 to the final
number faced.
Specialists and Lieutenants
The enemy force may include figures that are
armed in a different way.We refer to these
as Specialists and Lieutenants.They will both
roll separately for their weapons when these
are determined. Note that specialists and
lieutenants are not additional figures.They
are part of the number of opponents already
generated above, but are armed differently.
• If you encounter 1-2 opponents, no
Specialists will be present.
• If you encounter 3-6, one Specialist will
be present.
• If you encounter 7+, two Specialists
will be present.
If the campaign’s difficulty mode is Insanity,
one further Specialist will be present.
If you encounter 4 or more opponents, one
non-Specialist figure will be a Lieutenant.
They carry a Blade in addition to their normal
weapon, and increase their Combat Skill by
+1. If the opponents encountered are animals
that do not use weapons, the Lieutenant will
be a pack leader; increase Combat Skill by
+1, but make no other changes.
Unique Individuals
The enemy force may be led by a special
character.This might be the mastermind
behind their plan, someone they hired to aid
them, or a wandering adventurer like yourself.
Unless fighting an Invasion battle or an enemy
from the Roving Threats Subtable, roll 2D6.
• Add +1 if fighting opponents from the
Interested Parties Subtable.
93
Readying For Battle
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is
Hardcore, add +1.
On a roll of 9+, the opposition is
accompanied by a Unique Individual, and
you should check on that table.This figure
is always in addition to those normally
encountered.
If the figure has GuardianAI,it must be attached
to a figure in the enemy force.This will always
be a Lieutenant, if one is present; otherwise
just pick a random non-Specialist figure.
If the campaign’s difficulty mode is Insanity, a
Unique Individual is present, even if fighting a
Roving Threat. Roll 2D6 without any modifiers.
A result of 11-12 means you have to fight 2
Unique Individuals.

4. Set up the Battlefield
Determine Table Size
We recommend playing the battle on a
battlefield of either 2x2, 2.5 x 2.5, or 3x3 feet.
Larger areas than that usually ends up with table
space never being used; any smaller allows little
room for maneuver and positional tactics…and
tends to be bad news when angryVent Crawlers
show up! Mark off the playable area, and use
the excess for dice, drinks, notes, and so forth.
Terrain
For a good gaming experience, you generally
want a lot of terrain to move around and fight
over.Weusethreedifferentcategoriesof terrain:
Large Things
These can be single large terrain features such
as a hill, large comms dish, space shuttle,
large building, or forested area, or they
could be a cluster of smaller features such
as a storage dump of crates and fuel barrels,
scattered bushes, or similar.
• The feature should fill most of the sector
it’s placed in, with some space to move
around.
• A large feature should be big enough
that you have to take it into account
when playing: It obstructs sight,
provides a position to fight from, or
allows figures to climb around it.
• It also offers a visual centerpiece of the
table and helps establish a theme.
Small Things
These are smaller, individual features such
as boulders, small buildings, or shipping
containers.Alternatively, a couple of bushes,
2-3 barrels, storage containers, or trees in a
little cluster,or a scattering of rocks could work.
• A small feature typically offers a position
of Cover, while moving from place to
place or advancing on an objective.They
also help the table feel alive and more
like a real place you can imagine.
Linear Things
Linear terrain is a feature 4”-8” long, and
narrow, such as a barricade, security fence,
wall, or hedgerow.Alternatively, two pieces
placed with a gap between them or in an
L-shape can be used.
• These may block Line of Sight, but
typically act to provide Cover and a
movement obstacle.
• They tend to delineate the battlefield
into natural regions to defend.
Placing Terrain Features
Several missions depend on reaching the
center of the table. It’s good to place a
terrain feature in the center, so that there is
something visual that you are trying to reach
or interact with.Avoid placing big, cool-
looking terrain on the edges, as it will likely
not get used in the battle. Groups of smaller
items, such as rocks or barrels, work best when
they are placed in a cluster.
In arranging your terrain, it helps to think of
your table as divided into “sectors” of 10-12
inches along each side.A 3x3 table would
have nine such sectors, for example.
Arrange terrain features so that they are
spaced evenly across the table.The goal
is to have no huge, open expanses on the
table that are suicide to cross under fire.The
distance between features can vary, but 1-2
moves for an average character is usually fine.
After placing everything, you may wish
to step back and take a look at the table.
Shifting things a little bit or swapping two
pieces around can improve the look, as well
as avoiding obvious kill zones, or having too
many open lanes from battlefield edge to
battlefield edge.
108
Readying For Battle
The Standard Terrain Set
If you are building a standard set of terrain
for yourself, the following combinations are
suggested:
TYPE
2X2
FEET
2.5X2.5
FEET
3X3
FEET
Large 2 2 3
Small 4 5 6
Linear 2 4 3
Additionally, apply the following guidelines to
the features you construct or purchase:
• At least 2 features that can be climbed
upon, such as structures or rocky
outcroppings with natural platforms.
• At least 1 feature that raises above
the ground and offers elevated firing
positions, such as a hill.
• At least 1 feature that can be entered, such
as a forest, or cluster of rubble.
Terrain Relationships
The terrain pieces you have may suggest
a relationship to each other. If you have a
farmhouse and some fencing, those will look
better placed near each other, for example.
Likewise, if you have a selection of natural
features like trees, bushes, and some buildings,
it may look better to have the buildings on one
side of the table,and the vegetation on the other.
You may want to build a terrain collection by
theme; for example you may start with a sci-fi
colony theme, then add a second set with a
wilderness theme.
109
Readying For Battle
Establish Your Battlefield Edge
Once the terrain is set up and looking good,
randomly select which battlefield edge you
will be entering from.The enemy is always
assigned to the opposite edge.
Setting up the Figures
Set up the enemy first, then set up your forces,
ensuring no figures from opposing forces are
within 18” of each other at the beginning of
the game.
• Aggressive and Rampaging enemies
will set up in one “cluster” with 1”
between each figure.
• Tactical and Defensive enemies set up
divided evenly among 3 “teams”.Teams
areplaced8”apart.Teammembersshould
be 1-2” apart, depending on terrain.
• Cautious enemies are set up in two
“groups”, 6” apart. Members of those
groups should be 1.5-2” apart.
• Beast enemies are set up in pairs. Divide
the table in 3 roughly equal parts, and
place one pair in each, evenly spaced.
Each pair should have 2” between figures.

Encounter Generation Example
ENCOUNTER GENERATION
EXAMPLE
We are taking on an Opportunity mission.
The first step is to determine the Encounter
Category.The roll is a 40, which means we are
facing off against Hired Muscle of some sort.
Rolling on the Enemy Table, I get a 55: Feral
Mercenaries.
As I don’t have any suitable animal-person
hybrid figures, I will proxy those.The
“Number” listed in the Enemy Table is +2,
and because I have 6 crew members, I roll 2D6
(getting a 3 and 5), pick the higher die result,
and add that +2 for a total of 7 enemies.And
because there are 7+ enemy, that means 2 of
them will be Specialists.
I also need to roll to see if they are
accompanied by a Unique Individual.I roll 2D6
and score a 7, so one isn’t present this time.
From the Enemy Table I can see the weapon
code for the Ferals is 2 B.That means they roll
on Weapon column 2 and Specialist column
B. Using the ‘Varied Armaments’ optional rule,
I could roll twice for the weapon and have half
of the Ferals with each weapon, but since I am
just starting out, I just roll once. For the Ferals,
I roll a 3 – they are equipped with Military
Rifles, while I roll a 6 for their Specialists,
who each get a Rattle Gun.A lot of incoming
firepower can be expected!
Now that we’ve established who we are
dealing with, I roll on the Deployment
Conditions and Notable Sights Tables,
making sure to check the correct columns on
each table (we should be using the Opprtunity
column).The first roll is a 32: No special
conditions.The second is a 74: There’s a
Person of Interest on the table and if I can
reach them, I can earn a story point.
Next, I need to know what I am being paid to
do.A D10 roll on the Opportunity Mission
Objective Table produces an 8, telling me the
crew is trying to Patrol the area.
Okay,so creatively piecing these clues together,
I can imagine the locals are getting worried
about an off-world mining corp encroaching
on their mineral rights.The corp has sent in
mercenaries to scare them into submission
and they’ve taken to hiring some rowdy off-
worlders (namely us!) who can sympathize
with their cause.The Person of Interest is one
of the villagers who went out to inspect the
area and hasn’t returned. I need to make sure
he’s safe while doing a combat sweep.
Now I have all the context I need. It’s time to
place some terrain, set up the figures, and get
ready for battle!
111
Encounter Generation Example
THE BATTLE ROUND
Battles are split up into rounds of activity.A
round of battle is not a fixed period of time.
It can represent a few moments when a lot
of shooting is happening, and a couple of
minutes when you are just sneaking around.
Every round consists of the following phases:
1. The Reaction Roll
2. Quick Actions
3. Enemy Actions
4. Slow Actions
5. End Phase
Seizing the Initiative
After both sides have set up, and before
the first round of the battle, the player may
attempt to Seize the Initiative. If you’re
successful, your crew caught the opposition
flat-footed, and gets a chance to take up
positions or fire before the first round begins.
Roll 2D6.Add the highest Savvy score of any
crew member.
• Add +1 if you are outnumbered.
• When fighting opponents from the Hired
Muscle encounter tables, modify by -1.
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is
Hardcore, modify by -2.
• If the campaign’s difficulty mode is
Insanity, modify by -3.
Many opponent types will add a bonus or
penalty to the roll. If your crew includes
any Feral, you may ignore any penalties the
opponents would have imposed on you.
On a total of 10+, every character in your crew
may either take a normal Move or may fire
before the battle begins.Any shots taken only
Hit on a natural 6.
Note that although your crew may Seize the
Initiative momentarily, when the first round
begins, you will still have to make a new
Reaction Roll each and every round.You will
not get a second opportunity to Seize the
Initiative.
112
The Battle Round
The Reaction Roll
Each battle round, the first thing you will need
to establish is the order in which figures act.
This is the Reaction Roll. Roll a number of
D6 equal to the number of your characters.
Assign each of the dice results to one of your
characters,comparing it to their Reaction score:
• Any character assigned a die result
equal or below their Reaction score will
act in the Quick Actions phase.
• All enemies will act in the Enemy
Actions phase.
• Characters that were assigned a die
result higher than their Reaction score
will act in the Slow Actions phase.
Note that every figure always gets to act.
The round ends when all figures on both
sides have acted, and each phase has been
completed.
Feral Impetuous Actions
If your crew has a Feral character, and you roll
exactly a single 1 on your Initiative dice, it
must be assigned to a Feral character.This rule
does not apply if you roll multiple 1s.
Actions
During a phase, player characters acting
within that phase can act in any order desired.
During the Enemy Actions phase, enemy
figures begin with those closest to the player’s
battlefield edge, then progress away towards
the opposing battlefield edge. If two figures
are equally close, start on their left side.
When acting, a figure may make a Movement
Action and then perform a Combat Action.
A figure may opt to forego either option, but
cannot perform them in reverse order.
Some activities are Free Actions, such as
using a consumable item.A character can
perform one Free Action without inhibiting
their other activities. Carrying out two Free
Actions in the same round requires foregoing
the Combat Action for that round.
A Combat Action typically means firing a
weapon or Brawling, but some other actions
on the battlefield may require the use of that
figure’s Combat Action for that round.
Forexplanationof MovementandCombatAction
procedures, see pages 41 and 44 respectively.
Snap Fire
Characters that are eligible to act in the Quick
Actions phase may opt not to do so.This allows
them to either fire when an enemy moves, or
to delay until the Slow Actions phase. Firing
during an enemy move prevents the firing
character from moving this round.
If a moving enemy is Stunned as a result of
snap fire,they lose the ability to fire this round.
Characters that do not find an opportunity to
use snap fire in the Enemy Actions phase can
act normally in the Slow Actions phase.
Round Sequence Example
I have 4 crew members on the field
with Reaction ability scores of 1, 1,
2, 2.
I roll for Reactions, with results of 1,
2, 3, 5.
I can assign the Reaction Roll of 1 to
any character, and they will act in the
Quick Actions phase.The 2 should be
assigned to either of the characters
with Reactions 2. Of course, nothing
stops me assigning it to a character
with Reactions 1, but that’d be a waste
because then they would have a lower
Initiative than their Reaction score,
and would be forced to act in the Slow
Actions phase.
The 3 and 5 are then assigned to the
two remaining characters, both of
which will act in the Slow Actions phase.
113
The Battle Round
The End Phase
During this phase, carry out any end-of-round
activities,such as checking if a defeated enemy
force withdraws from battle (see below). If the
rules say something happens at the end of
the round, this is when it happens.You may
resolve any such events in any order you like.
Running Away
At the end of each round, the enemy will test
Morale if they lost any figures during the round
just played. If the enemy fails their test, some
of them will Bail, fleeing the field of battle.
Roll a number of dice equal to the number of
figures that were removed due to combat this
round. Casualties from environmental hazards
or other terrain concerns are not counted.
Every die that falls within the Panic range for
the enemy type indicates one of them will
Bail.
Apply each die to an enemy figure, starting
with the figures closest to the enemy
battlefield edge.These figures Bail and are
removed from play.They do not count as
“killed” for any purposes, and do not trigger
additional Morale dice to be rolled.
Some enemy types have a Panic range of 0,
indicating that they fight to the death, unless
some factor raises their Panic range to 1 or
more.
Morale Example
During the current game round, the enemy
lost 2 figures.Their Panic range is 1-2.
2D6 are rolled because 2 figures were lost.
One die shows a 5 – not within the Panic
range, so it is ignored.The other is a 1 – within
the Panic range for these opponent.,That
result is assigned to the enemy figure closest
to enemy battlefield edge. Unless that figure
is immune to Morale effects, it flees the battle,
and is removed from the table.
Fearless
Some enemies, including all Lieutenants,
are Fearless.They will never Bail, regardless
of circumstances.These troops do not have
Morale dice applied to them. Simply skip
them and apply the die to the next closest
figure to the enemy battlefield edge
Player Morale
Player forces do NOT test Morale. Instead, you
may abandon the fight by moving crew off any
battlefield edge. Note that while you do not
have to flee off your own original battlefield
edge, if you are fighting on an interior map
such as a spaceship hull or underground
complex,you will have to move to a reasonable
exit.Once a crew member leaves the table,they
cannot return during the battle. Moving the
final crew member off the table ends the fight.
Ending the Battle
A battle ends in one of the following
circumstances. It is important to establish
whether you achieved your objective, and/or
Held the Field, which is important for rewards
and accomplishing some missions:
• All enemy figures have been slain
or have Bailed. In this case, you are
considered to have Held the Field.
Consult the mission objective to
determine if your battle objective can
still be completed.
• If you have achieved the Win condition
of your objective, your enemy may give
up. Rampaging or Beast opponents will
fight until either side has completely
left the table. For other AI types, roll as
indicated below at the end of the current
and every subsequent round based on
the main AI type present:
• 2D6 for Cautious, Defensive or
Tactical opponents.
• 1D6 for Aggressive opponents.
114
The Battle Round
If either die is a natural 1, the enemy
withdraws and the battle ends
immediately,with you Holding the Field.
• All player figures have become
casualties or have left the battlefield.
You do not Hold the Field.
• All player figures left the battlefield,
having achieved your objectives before
exiting the battle, or the “It’s Time to
Go” option from Stars of the Story
(p.67) may have been invoked.You do
not Hold the Field.
If for some reason you have to end a tabletop
battle for any other reason, you do not count
as achieving any objectives or Holding the
Field.
115
The Battle Round
BATTLE EVENTS (OPTIONAL)
Battle Events add a random component to the tabletop battle beyond the simple to Hit rolls and
damage checks.At the end of Round 2 of the battle, roll once on this table and apply the result
to the gaming table. Roll a second random event at the end of Round 4. No additional events
are rolled. In some cases the two events can be incompatible or non-sensible when both applied.
If so, discard the second event with no effect.
Use of this table is optional – you may choose to use it occasionally during your campaign, or not
at all.
ROLL EFFECT
1-5 Renewed efforts: The enemy is making a concerted effort to push you back. For the rest of the
battle, after all enemy figures have acted, select a random figure that may immediately take a
second Move and second Combat Action.
6-9 Enemy reinforcements: An additional 2 enemy figures arrive at the center of the opposing
battlefield edge. One is armed as a Specialist (if applicable to the enemy type).
10-13 Change of plans: The enemy switches to the Cautious AI type for the rest of the battle. If they
were already Cautious, they instead switch to Tactical AI. Enemies with no ranged attacks are
unaffected by this event.
14-16 Lost heart: The enemy has had enough of this fight.At the end of the next round, they will
leave the field.
17-20 Seized the moment: Select a crew member who may move and act in both the Quick and Slow
Actions phases next round.
21-26 Critters! Place 1D3 Vent Crawlers (p.102) in the center of the table, and move each of them
1D6” in a random direction.At the beginning of the Enemy Actions phase, they will move
towards the nearest figure and attack, regardless of which side the figure is on. If you are
already fighting Vent Crawlers, this is bad news, as they are of course part of the enemy brood.
27-30 Ammo fault: Select a random figure in your crew. If they fired a weapon last round, it cannot
be used for the rest of the battle. If they did not, select a random carried weapon, which can be
fired only once this battle.
31-34 Visibility change: If visibility is currently reduced, increase the vision range by +1D6”. If
visibility is currently unlimited, reduce it to 1D6+6”.
35-38 Tougher than expected: Select a random enemy figure.They receive +1 Toughness (to a
maximum of 6) and remove all current stun markers on that figure.
39-42 Snap shot: Select a figure in your crew.They may fire a weapon immediately. If the weapon is a
Pistol, it Hits automatically, otherwise roll to Hit normally.
43-46 Cunning plan: In the next round, do not roll for Initiative. Each of your crew acts in the Quick or
Slow Actions phase as you prefer.

ROLL EFFECT
47-50 Possible reinforcements: Place 3 markers evenly spaced along the opposing battlefield
edge.At the start of the Enemy Actions phase next round, select a random marker, and roll 1D6.
On a 5-6, a new basic enemy figure is placed on the marker, otherwise it is removed. Roll for
one marker per round until they are all gone. If a crew member moves within 3” of a marker, it
is removed instantly.
51-54 Clock is running out: At the end of the next round and each round thereafter, roll 1D6. On a 6,
the game ends immediately, and you are unable to complete any objectives.You will not count
as Holding the Field unless you clear the table of enemies before this happens.
55-60 Environmental hazard: Select a random terrain feature.Any figure currently in,on,or within 1”
of the feature must roll 1D6+Savvy and achieve a 5+ (enemies roll 1D6 and must roll a 4+)
or take a Damage +1 Hit, ignoring any Armor Saving Throws.The feature is safe afterwards.
61-65 A desperate plan: A random figure in your crew cannot act next round, but instead select
another figure of choice that may act in both the Quick and Slow Actions phases.
66-70 A moment of hesitation: Next round,select a single figure that acts in the QuickActions phase (if
any Feral are in the squad,you must select a Feral).All other figures acts in the SlowActions phase.
71-73 Fumbled grenade: A random enemy fumbles a grenade.The figure in question runs 6” in a
random direction and is then Stunned. Every figure, crew and enemy within 4” of the initial
position will immediately run 4” directly away.The grenade then goes off harmlessly. If the
enemy is one that would not use grenades, nothing happens.
74-77 Back up: If you have spare crew not taking part in the battle, you may have one crew member
arrive. Place them on the center of your own battlefield edge.
78-80 Enemy VIP: A Unique Individual immediately joins the enemy force. Place them on the center
of their battlefield edge.
81-85 Fog cloud: A dense cloud of fog envelops the center of the table for the rest of the battle. It
extends 6” in every direction and blocks all visibility past 2”.
86-89 Lost! A random crew member loses their way and misses the rest of the battle. Remove the
figure from the battlefield.They rejoin you safely afterwards, looking a bit sheepish. Ignore this
event if you are currently outnumbered.
90-93 I found something! Randomly select a crew member, then place a marker 1D6” from them
in a random direction.The enemy will ignore it. If any crew member moves into contact and
spends a non-Combat Action, roll for a Loot item (p.131) and claim it for use immediately.
94-97 Looks valuable: Randomly select a crew member, then place a marker 1D6” from them in a
random direction.The enemy will ignore it. If any crew member moves into contact and spends
a non-Combat Action, obtain 1D3 credits.
98-100 You want me to check that out? Select a random crew member.They may opt to go check out
something they insist they saw. If they do, they are removed from the battle.After the battle
ends, they may roll once on the Loot table (p.131). If you opt not to go, you cannot send a
different character, and the chance is lost.

POST-BATTLE ACTIVITIES
1. Resolve Rival Status
If you fought an opponent that isn’t a Rival
and Held the Field, roll 1D6. On a 1, the type
of opponents you just fought become your
Rivals, and should be noted for this planet.
On any other roll, they either had enough, or
figured “business is business”, and will leave
you alone.
If you just fought against an existing Rival
and Held the Field, roll a 1D6, adding +1 if
you Tracked them down during Assign and
Resolve Crew Tasks (see World Step, p.76).
Add +1 if you killed a Unique Individual in the
battle. On a 4 or better, they’ve had enough,
and you can remove them from your Rivals list.
Skip this step for Invasion battles, or after
fighting opponents from the Roving Threats
Subtable.
2. Resolve Patron Status
If you succeeded in a Patron mission,you may
add the Patron to your list of contacts on this
planet,unless the job was a One-time Contract.
When you travel to a new planet,all Patrons
become unavailable,unless they are Persistent.

3. Determine Quest Progress
If you just fought a battle that was part of a
Quest, roll a D6. If you have obtained any
Quest Rumors, add +1 for each Rumor you
have accumulated while on this Quest. If you
did not Win the battle, the roll is modified by
a -2.
• On a modified score of 3 or less, this
place was a dead end, and the Quest
continues.
• On a modified score of 4, 5 or 6, you are
a step closer. Gain a Quest Rumor.
• On a score of 7 or higher, you’re at the
conclusion of the Quest. Next time you
pursue a Quest mission, it will be the
finale.This will always be a Straight-up
Fight.You must add +1 to the number
of opponents faced, and the opponents
will be Fearless.
If the modified roll was a 4 or higher, roll
another D6 with no modifiers. On a 5-6, the
next step is on another world, and you must
travel before you are able to progress the
Quest.You do not have to do so immediately,
however. Quests will wait for you.
4. Get Paid
You earn 1D6 credits in pay, loot, bounty or
salvage. If you finished the final mission of a
Quest, roll the die twice, pick the better score,
and add +1 to the total. If you finished an
Invasion Battle, you receive no payment.
• Add +1 if the campaign is played in
Easy mode.
• If you Won the mission by completing
your objective, treat any roll of 1 or 2
as a 3. Rival missions do not award this
bonus for Winning.
• If you did a Patron job, add the Pay
bonus to the Danger Pay. Some Patrons
will allow additional Benefits upon
completion.
5. Battlefield Finds
If you Held the Field after the battle, you
had an opportunity afterwards to search the
battlefield for anything worth collecting.You
may do so even if you failed to achieve or did
not have an objective.This is in addition to any
Loot you might be allowed to claim.You cannot
roll on this table after an Invasion battle.

Invaded. Roll 2D6.
• Add +1 if you acquired Invasion
Evidence in the previous step.

Roll once on the Loot Table (p.131) to see what
you’ve earned. Some circumstances may offer
additionalrolls.Ifyoujustfinishedthefinalstageof
aQuest,rollthree times andclaimalltheitems.
Note that some opponents may not logically
carry anything of value. If so, you may assume
the item is acquired in their lair, found en
route, or is something you bartered for.
If you just played an Invasion Battle, you
receive no Loot.
8. Determine Injuries and Recovery
Any character that became a casualty in the
battle must roll on the Injury Table below (Bot
and Soulless characters use the Bot Injury
Table instead). If a character was merely
knocked out (from suffering 3 Stun results
simultaneously), no roll is required.
If a character with Luck would be slain through
a roll on this table, they miraculously survive,
but immediately lose ALL Luck points.They
can earn additional points as normal in the
future. Unless this occurs, spent Luck points
are now recovered automatically.

Post Battle Activities
10. Invest in Advanced Training
At this stage you may opt to invest in
Advanced Training.Advanced Training
courses give a character expertise that will
allow them to improve or reroll vital checks
during the campaign, as well as some other
benefits. Select a crew member who wishes to
attend, pay an application fee of 1 credit, and
roll 2D6, requiring a 4+ to be approved. On
a failed roll, you can try again later. Only one
attempt is permitted per campaign turn.
Select a course to enroll in and pay the course
cost.The cost can be paid using unspent XP,
credits or any combination thereof.
Example:
I want to send a crew member to get Pilot
Training with a cost of 20.The character has
8 unspent XP I can use, so I’d have to pay the
rest as an additional 12 credits.
After paying the cost, the character obtains
the new training and may start using it in
the following campaign turn. Learning is
rather quick using a combination of Neural-
Reality Instruction and Sub-Logic-Insertion
techniques.All quite safe, of course!
Although characters currently in Sick Bay can
undergo Advanced Training, the benefits of
the Advanced Training cannot be employed
while the crew member is in Sick Bay.
Each crew member can only ever be trained in
a single course, and you cannot benefit from
more than one crew member with the same
training. However, you may have multiple
crew members with the same training in the
team; after all, having a spare ‘Doc’ can come
in handy if one gets hurt!
Bots can have a training module installed, but
the cost must be paid in credits exclusively.

Post Battle Activities
ADVANCED TRAINING COURSE COST
Pilot Training 20
If a StarshipTravel event calls for a Savvy test,you may roll 2D6,pick the better die and add +2 to the score.
Mechanic training 15
If your ship is in need of Repairs, you may repair +1 Hull Point damage every campaign turn (meaning
2 points of damage are repaired per campaign turn). Engineers count any XP spent as double value for
obtaining this.
Medical school 20
After each battle, you may nominate a casualty that will roll twice on the Injury Table, picking the better
result.This crew member must have been in the battle and must not have become a casualty. If your ship
has a Shuttle, you can evac fast enough that this crew member can apply their skill even if they did not
participate in the battle.
Merchant school 10
When this crew member Trades, you may reroll one Trade roll each campaign turn.The new roll must be
accepted and if the new roll offers a choice of whether to buy an item, you must accept.You may roll up all
eligible Trade rolls before choosing what to reroll.
Security training 10
If this crew member is part of your squad when fighting a battle, you may add +1 when rolling to Seize
the Initiative. Ferals can obtain this training at -2 Cost.
Broker training 15
When rolling to obtain licenses,Advanced Training applications,or searching for Patrons,add +1 to the
roll.
Bot technician 10
All Bot upgrades cost 1 credit less. If a Bot or Soulless character must roll for a post-battle injury, you may
roll twice, picking the better result.
11. Purchase Items
You may pay 3 credits to receive a roll on
the Military Weapon Table, Gear Table or
Gadget Table in the Character Creation
chapter (p.28-29).
• You may purchase more than one roll
per campaign turn.
• You may purchase any number of Hand
Guns, Blades, Colony Rifles, or Shotguns
for 1 credit each.
• You may sell up to 3 un-damaged items,
earning 1 credit for each.
If you are lacking a ship, you can acquire
a new one. Consult the rules in the “Your
Starship” chapter of the game rules.You may
also buy Ship Upgrades at this stage. Consult
the appropriate chapter of the rules for details
on these.
12. Roll for a Campaign Event

Sick Bay.If the selected character is a Precursor,
you may roll twice and pick either score.
Apply the result immediately. In some cases,
an event may end up not making any sense. If
so, tweak or ignore it, as necessary. If an event
is completely inapplicable, simply add +1 XP

A random item carried by the character is damaged, and must be Repaired before it can be
used again. Engineers are not affected by this event.
92-94 Where did it go?
A random item carried by the character has been lost.When rolling for a Character Event next
campaign turn, roll 1D6+Savvy as well. On a 5+, the item turns up again, otherwise it is lost
for good.
95-97 A deep feeling of melancholy and despair is afflicting you.
The character will earn no XP next campaign turn.
K’Erin are not affected by this event.
98-100 You’ve had a lot of time to burn.
Next campaign turn,the character may perform an additional action,even if they are in Sick Bay.

Post Battle Activities
Loot
Many events in the game will allow you to roll on the Loot Table (it is customary to blow on the
dice for good luck at this point).This usually requires three rolls, though the process can be sped
up by using percentile dice in distinct colors. Roll to determine the category, then the subtable,
and finally the exact item in question.
If you are awarded multiple Loot rolls, you may keep each item.

POST-BATTLE EXAMPLE
After a hard-fought battle, I am ready to do the
post-battle rolls.
Since we fought someone that wasn’t a Rival, I
have to see if they hold a grudge.
A D6 roll of a 2 indicates they do not, luckily –
we have enough to worry about.
As this was not a Patron or Quest mission, I
can skip those steps.
Of course, we want to get paid. I Won, so I roll
1D6 and score 4 credits for the Stash.The Hot
Tip was worth another 3 credits.
As we Held the Field, we can roll D100 on
the Battlefield Find Table.The roll is 82:
Some Vital Info.We can hand this over to the
rightful owners and add a Corporate Patron.
We didn’t fight an Invasion Threat type of
opponent, so I don’t have to worry about an
army showing up suddenly.
We get to roll once on the Loot Table.The roll
is 68: Odds and Ends, followed by 83: Ship
Items.The final roll is 22 giving us some Fake
ID.Well, you never know when that might
come in handy.
Unfortunately, during the fight, both Shi and
Simon became casualties.The roll for Shi is 49:
Serious Injury, putting them in Sick Bay for 3
campaign turns.Simon was only 91: Knocked
Out, so they are fine. I may have to find a
temporary replacement next campaign turn.
I mark down Experience Points for everyone.
The two characters that became casualties get
1 XP each, while the rest get 3 XP.Tank was
the first to score a casualty, so he earns +1
bonus XP.That gives him enough to buy a
Character Upgrade, increasing Toughness by
+1, at a cost of 6 XP.
I am not interested in Advanced Training at the
moment, but I do purchase items, acquiring 2
Blades and another Hand Gun for a total of 3
credits (1 per item).
The Campaign Events roll is 74, and the crew
spend a movie night getting drunk, worth
+1 story point. I randomly select Twitch for
a Character Event and,with a roll of 37,her
sharp ears pick up a Rumor in town. Nice.
With all of this, I am ready to tackle the next
campaign turn!
Post-Battle Example
Unity
A united, coherent, galaxy-spanning
government encompassing all of humanity
and countless aliens granted human status,
Unity has come to be synonymous with
“galactic civilization” to most humans.
To the loyal, it stands as the beacon of all that
is lawful, orderly, and uplifting.
To the cynical, it is the embodiment of
suffocating control and enforced conformity.
To the extremist, it is deviation from mankind’s
right to rule by fire.
For most- it is simply a way to live, a necessary
mechanization of bureaucracy that ensures
the slow, grinding progress of mankind.
Tasked with a broad charter of “Defending the
interests of humanity at large and in detail”,
Unity functions as government, military,
and culture.To ensure social cohesion,
active measures are taken to encourage
approved cultural trends, allowing a degree of
monoculture to exist across a thousand worlds.
Backed by massive military force, whether you
live within its Core Worlds, in uncontrolled
Fringe space, or in an alien polity, Unity
is a force that must be accounted for and
contended with.
In addition to the masses of humanity, Unity
also encompasses alien species which were
either “inducted” through warfare or that have
chosen to join Unity in order to benefit from
the coalescence of multiple minds and species
working together.
As such, optimal cultural standards from a
variety of existing Earth cultures were selected
and amalgamated into one “Human” culture,
mandated by law across each system.The
bureaucracy carefully evaluates inducted
cultures to select desirable traits that will be
slowly propagated across the Core Worlds.
Cultural Exemption treaties are granted to
harmonious and unique civilizations.
Acquiescing to Unity’s rules and structures
means being rewarded with access to
standardized trade rules, protection of
the fleets, and a bevy of other economic
opportunities.
Pavel Excelian, scholar of the Unity Academic
Consortium, is quoted as stating:
“Worlds and planets of course can choose to be
“free” of Unity’s folds - but that freedom comes
often with the cost of famine, disease, poverty,
and death. It is a freedom to die, rather than
to live”

Unity
FASTER THAN LIGHT TRAVEL
In eons past, Humanity was a cloistered
species - anchored to Earth by its lack of
technology and resources, the human race
was only free to expand within the confines of
sub-light travel.
The turning point came from a team of
scientists led by the visionary Haruka Lee. She
discovered so-called Weak Points in the fabric
of space which, with careful calculation, could
be connected to another known Weak Point
and used to “tunnel” through space.
Over the course of a few years, humanity
was able to truly take to the stars and did so
aggressively in a massive burst of colonization.
While other species have come to the same
technological means by other methods, the
Svensen drive remains the most common
method of allowing a starship to Tunnel.
Travel time under Unity-standard Svensen
drive is about 3 days per light year Tunneled
through, though some distortion can occur.A
10% deviation in travel time is typical, though
the best navigators insist they can get it down
as low as 2%.
Weak Points move through space along
predictable paths, allowing a ship with
updated Tunnel Charts to travel reliably. It is
possible to emerge from Tunnel travel without
a Weak Point, but this can lead to substantial
deviations. Ships may emerge as much as
a light year from their intended destination
point and accidents are not uncommon.
Larger worlds maintain energy-intensive
Karlenhertz generators in orbit which are able
to force-generate a stable, non-wandering
Weak Point.This allows highly industrialized
worlds to act as natural Tunnel Points and
traffic hubs.
Other species have their own methods, from
the brute “Rip” technique used by Converted
war fleets, to the semi-mystical rituals of
Precursor navigators but these fundamentally
rely on the same or adjacent principles. Unity,
the K’Erin, and the Precursors have granted
Tunnel-compatible technology to minor
species they have uplifted, allowing for a fairly
wide proliferation of star-faring cultures.
137
Faster Than Light Travel
THE FRINGE OF SPACE
In a utopian view, there are those who
perceive and describe Unity as being the
height of human evolution.
In a more realistic view, Unity is an
organization that struggles under the weight
of its own massive size.
Corralling untold billions of sentient beings
into cooperation is largely impossible,and in a
drive for efficiency and mere function,Unity has
become an impersonal bureaucracy that keeps
itself busy mainly with basic security and safety,
perpetuating itself and crushing dissent.
It is this impersonal, suffocating red tape that
pushes many to find freedom in the expanses
of the galaxy.
As the Unity colonies expanded, it became
obvious that there were many dissidents who
chafed at the bureaucratic constraints that
Unity used to bind and control communities
over several worlds.
On the main Unity worlds, there was a
growing number of rebels and dissidents who
proclaimed that they were willing to live with
laws and protections, but wanted the freedom
and ability to grow and develop cultural ties
that Unity simply did not approve of.
Intense suppression of these ideas led to
increasingly violent protests, and thus many
of the central worlds became like a boiler
without a valve - ready to blow at any moment.
Thuscamethe“FringeExpansion”,thebrainchild
of entrepreneur and investor Jonathan Meeks.
Devised as an exploration into the “fringe”
planets of Unity galaxies, the project was
originally proposed as a sort of galactic test
tube - an experiment to release the pressure
on some of the more populated and conflicted
worlds by populating planets that did not
possess a wealth of profitable resources, but
were able to sustain life.
138
The Fringe of Space
It was hoped that these worlds could cultivate a
more radical and vibrant culture, which in turn
would feed valuable concepts back,where they
could be assimilated cautiously before a given
world was re-admitted into Unity.
Referred to simply as “the Fringe”, these
worlds are formally under Unity control but
for all practical terms are allowed to self-
govern, so long as the local governments and
authoritative collectives maintain a reasonable
level of control.
Individuals (both human and alien) saw the
chance to establish hubs of black market
trading, hideouts from Unity authorities, and a
list of illicit, Unity banned activities to benefit
from. Smuggling, crime, and petty warfare is
rampant as warlords establish their claims to
this or that sub-sector of space.
Unitymilitarypatrolsarecommon,bothtofendoff
alien invasions and to intervene when planetary
warfare threatens to get out of hand,though any
signof awarfleettendstoinflamelocaluprisings
and rebellions as often as they quell them.
As the presence of hostile forces is well
understood, most worlds maintain at least one
Unity naval base for security. Special agents
prowl the Fringes constantly, searching for
destabilizing elements and external threats.
These agents are often given wide-ranging
authority and have been known to hire
mercenary bands, salvage captains, and
outright criminals to assist in their tasks.
Due to the lack of a central, governing culture,
Fringe worlds tend to exhibit substantial
variation. Some worlds are hellholes, where
death waits at every corner. Others are far
more environmentally palatable, where the
supply of resources (food, water, air) allows for
a basic order to be formed.
Some worlds, like Zitian 6, are largely
agricultural worlds where the inhabitants
petitioned for the right to live a “low” tech
eco-friendly society.
Rashor 4, a “craggy, acid-aired mess of a
world” however, attracts those looking to hide
in the last place any Unity enforcement officer
wants to go.
While Meeks envisioned worlds of peaceful,
cooperative societies, the reality was far
less idyllic. Far from the original idea of an
interplanetary utopian monk, the sort of
person that prefers to live outside the insanity
inducing bureaucracy of Unity include
free traders, gamblers, petty adventurers,
mercenaries, pirates, bandits, revolutionaries,
religious fanatics and many more, all
mingling in the cities, slums, bars, space ports,
and waste lands of the Fringe worlds.
As a result of this largely unmitigated societal
evolution,the colonies and societies within the
Fringe worlds are widely varied.Upon entering
a colony, almost any type of society can be
encountered, from Fuel Cultists and monk-
pirates,to robots attempting to abolish speech.
One benefit of living on the Fringe is that an
individual can likely find a world that suits
them and any particular quirks they may
possess. In even the more mild and peaceful
communities, citizens are unlikely to be scared
of aliens and freaks because everyone there
tends to be one or the other.
There is often an unstated agreement that a
person’s history in Unity is best left forgotten,
though bounty hunters, Unity agents, and
Tax Enforcers often disagree, leading to yet
another sprawling gun battle in the star
ports as the long arm of galactic law collides
with those who are both heavily armed and
inclined to be left alone.
Spanning around an estimated thousand
worlds, though it’s doubtful anyone knows the
exact number, a person who prefers staying
one step ahead of the authorities can find
plenty of opportunities to do so here.
139
The Fringe of Space
TRADE ON THE FRINGE
While Unity enforces a common monetary
system backed by the various institutions
of banking and insurance needed for a
massive economy to function, on the Fringes
counterfeiting of local currency is so rife and
independent rulers, communities, and petty
warlords have attempted to introduce so many
local currencies that anything significant is
traded in either Unity Credits or barter.
Free traders, scavengers, and salvage teams
usually carry a sizable amount of gadgets,trade
goods, and technology in various states of
repair which can be traded for desired goods.
Formal merchant organizations tend to have
complex systems of commerce and exchange
rates to ensure consistent trades from virtually
any commodity to another.This ensures that
if the merchant needs to convert vegetables
to plasma rifle power cells, the exchange goes
according to approved rates.
Most adventuring types simply hope to find
the item they need, in exchange for an item
they don’t need. It’s common for travelers to
acquire various surplus goods on the chance
they can be bartered later or that they may
turn out to be handy after all.
LOCAL AUTHORITY
Each community on the Fringe manages itself.
Some have formal systems of government,
particularly those communities centered
around specific belief systems. Others are
run by the citizens in some form of organized
anarchy and yet others are complete wild zones.
Since communities often face external threats,
each community invariably has some form of
local defense force.These may be recruited,
trained, volunteered, or drafted in any number
of ways.Visitors will usually pay an entrance
fee to the local guard, whether in ammunition,
spare parts, bits of armor and uniform, Unity
army rations or similar useful items.
Someone moving into a community will
usually have to serve a stint in the guard
unless they have a valuable skill that is in
demand, such as mechanics or doctors.
In other regions, it’s cheaper to hire someone
to do the security work.The distinction
between “mercenary” and “pirate” can be
pretty thin and many units carry out a variety
of operations.
As it’s primarily a reputation-based system,
mercenary outfits tend to be a lot more honest
than may be expected at first.
140
Trade on the Fringe
THE REACH OF UNITY
While the massive apparatus of Unity
administration moves at a glacial pace, many
smaller divisions are nimbler.
Knowing that the Fringes are rife with
renegades, rebels, dangerous aliens, and law
breakers,countless Unity agents operate across
the thousand worlds that make up the Fringe.
Some are simply observers; every Fringe
world has at least some semblance of an
official garrison, while others are there to
hunt down dangerous prey or keep an eye on
potential trouble.
In these pursuits, local “trouble shooters”
and even criminal elements may be hired to
provide muscle when needed.Field Agents are
generally operating above the law and while
they often have to rely on locally procured
allies in Fringe space, they do carry the
potential full weight of Unity behind them.
While official policy is notoriously indifferent
to local concerns, operatives often are not,
and they will usually try to interface with what
passes for local authorities and power groups
to achieve their aims.
Likewise, they will tend to encourage policies,
beliefs, and social structures that are at least
acceptable to mainstream Unity processes,
theoreticallytoreducetheamountofcultureshock
that occurs when a world is finally reclaimed.
Being a Field Agent means being one of the
few who are not only authorized but explicitly
expected to operate outside the box and
embrace alien ways of thinking and operating.
UNITY INTERVENTION
Whenever chaos, warfare, and destruction
spiral out of control in the Fringe, the heavy
hand of Unity tends to come crashing down
to prevent things getting worse.This can
come from local army garrisons, sector naval
bases, or even a full military expedition.The
request may be made by Field Agents, loyalist
segments of the population, or even planetary
governments.
Lacking any understanding of local political
situations and any appreciation whatsoever
of why such understanding would be useful,
the only response possible is usually a heavy
handed one. Once the bureaucracy has
approved a response and it is underway, it is
carried out according to Unity expectations
and requirements.
This typically involves substantial military forces,
interdiction,and forceful disarming of dissident
or rival factions. It is not uncommon for the
current regime to be replaced with a more
compliant one,even in cases where the regime
was the party appealing for intervention.
Less direct intervention may take the form of
military aid to sympathetic factions or financial
interdiction of a world, forcing compliance
through economic collapse.
When the intervention is over, the world is
evaluated for financial aid and recolonization.
Invasion forces are typically left in place,
transitioning to peacekeeping duties and
eventually simply melding into the population.
Of course, this can result in a population with
bitter memories of Unity intervention and well
supplied with leftover military hardware. It is
not at all unknown for former Unity officers to
wind up leading a rebellion when the fires of
discontent get too widespread.
141
The Reach of Unity
THE HUMAN CONDITION
Humans on the Fringes are in many ways
similar to humans of present-day Earth.While
distinct ethnic types still exist, hundreds of
years of mingling of different cultures have
mostly given rise of a fairly uniform “Modern
Human” type that can be found anywhere.
Over-the counter genetic manipulation has
given rise to a surprising range of artificial
body modifications. Green skin, cat tails,
glowing purple eyes, and more are not
unusual at all. On more affluent worlds,
“genetic renegades” who embrace large-scale
modification have become common, seeking
to replace outdated human genetics with
more exciting forms.
Less permanent forms of expression are
common as well: Hair and dress styles vary
wildly and don’t often form coherent styles
even within a small community.
Unity strictly regulates belief systems,fostering
a code of civil-minded responsibility to add
meaningtotheday-to-daydrudgeryof organized
life. Fringe space, lacking these restrictions,
tends to embrace a wide, occasionally manic,
range of codes and belief systems.
On most modern worlds, medical technology
and selective genetic editing is responsible
for a generally healthy population. Chronic
illness is infrequent, birth-defects are mostly
corrected for and average life expectancy is
around 110.
Most humans are raised to speak Unified
Standard, a shared language that is mandated
on all Core Worlds and mostly standard in the
Fringe as well. Even many aliens speak it for
practical purposes as it has been specifically
developed to be adaptable to as many speech
patterns as possible.
142
The Human Condition
BEYOND HUMANITY
The galaxy is home to thousands of sentient
species, though a relatively small number
have achieved star travel.
The Precursors, K’Erin, and Unity have all
uplifted countless species, “guiding” them
through technological advancement and
development, typically in the hopes of
creating long-term allies and client cultures.
The Precursors are one of the oldest star-
faring species known.They are a species
of mystic proportions, speaking of being
attuned to a mysterious flow of the cosmos
that the younger species are not privy to.
They have been an active force on the galactic
stage since their first steps to the stars and
interaction with humanity has generally been
constructive.
Their resemblance to humanity has given
rise to a number of Shared Origin theories,
but neither species finds such implications
particularly comfortable.
The K’Erin are a warlike species engaged in near
perpetual conflict and expansion along their
borders.They value warfare on its own merits
and often find excuses to engage in it.This has
led to many independent worlds accepting
their overlordship in return for battalions of
battle-hardened troops to be stationed there
in eager anticipation of an invasion.
Unity has fought many lengthy wars against the
K’Erin, but has found them dependable allies
against incursions of the Converted as well.
From the edges of space come the Soulless.
Named by a human explorer making first
contact, they are a “species” of networked
robotic organisms.Their ultimate goals are
unknown, though since contact they have
worked ceaselessly to integrate themselves
into galactic society, including adapting
physical forms and methods of interaction that
humans and others find easier to interact with.
Their ultimate goal is only speculated at, but
the constant flow of high-quality, in demand
electronic goods from the Soulless tends to
defuse any suspicions
The diminutive reptilian aliens known
commonly as The Swift are a mysterious elder
species. It is commonly accepted that they
already existed as a sentient civilization when
even the Precursors emerged from barbarism
but they have essentially settled into a state
of technological mysticism where they seem
content to remain.
Deeply superstitious, they follow an erratic
and incomprehensible caste system where
individuals discover their purpose in life at
seemingly random moments.
The species nicknamed the Engineers are a
common sight in star ports. Controlling only
a few small sectors, their lack of territorial
ambitions and natural inclination for working
with electronics and mechanical tools have
made them eagerly sought after across space.
It is commonly believed the Engineers must
have been genetically engineered as they
exhibit strong evidence of built-in genetic
memory, granting an unusual species-wide
aptitude for technology.
Unity researchers have dabbled in genetic
modification themselves, often resulting in
semi-human sub-species like the Hulkers
or Stalkers. Ferals are one of the more
widespread Human-Animal hybrid species
incorporating aspects of both parent species.
Ferals come in a variety of forms though
canine hybrids are the most common and
widespread. Under Unity law they are
considered legally human.
A bewildering range of other species exist in
the galaxy, including the hated Abductor clone
armies and the terrifying Converted cyborg
invaders, but space precludes more than this
cursory examination.

APPENDIX I: THE NEW EDITION
If you are an experienced player, you will find
much that is familiar.We haven’t changed
how the basic game mechanics function, and
the campaign still follows the same general
structure of “do stuff in town, fight a battle,
collect rewards”.You still “Level Up” your crew
(now called a “Character Upgrade”), and hope
they all survive.
However, there are many changes in the book.
Some are quite small,like a rule being reworded
slightly. Some areas have been expanded
substantially,and new content has been added.
Wherever possible, we have aimed to make
changes that either improved the flow of the
game, streamlined things where complexity
didn’t add anything, and / or added new
playable content and variation to the system.
Make sure to read the new game rules
carefully before diving in.While we expect
most people will want to roll a new crew once
they see the new character creation options,
if you have an existing crew, you should be
able to carry over your campaign and just
start using the new rules. Here are a few
noteworthy adjustments, however:
Characters
In most cases, characters should transfer over
without any problems. If you have characters
from one of the old versions with half-point
ability scores, round any such score up to a
full point (so 5.5” movement speed would
become 6”, for example).

Many weapons and items have changed
the mechanics for how they work. Our
recommendation is that you start using the
new mechanics for all items. In most cases,
they should be more fun and interesting.
You may opt to keep using the item with its
original mechanics, though you may have to
apply the odd house rule if something quirky
happens. If you prefer this option for a given
item,anynewitemyoufindof thesametypewill
follow the new rules given in this book.Basically,
your crew has an old Mk I version of the gadget.
Missing Features
Depending on the version of the rules you are
converting from, you may lack features such as
Luck (p.46) or story points (p.66). If this is the
case, simply grant 1 point of Luck to the crew
member you like the best. For story points,
roll normally, as if you were starting a brand-
new campaign.
FiveCore Players
These notes are for players of the second
edition rules. If you are an old dog trying
to convert from the FiveCore-based original
version, you will simply have to recreate your
crew under the new rules as best you can. Go
ahead and add 3 extra story points and an
extra point of Luck to your crew’s Leader as a
loyalty bonus, though!
APPENDIX II: PLAYING ON A GRID
The use of gridded maps is popular with
roleplaying games, and adapting floor plans,
battle mats, and floor tiles to miniatures
gaming is simple.This section offers some
guidelines for using such playing aids,
although common sense will answer most
questions that come up during play.
Note that you may opt to ignore the grid,
instead measuring and moving around
the floor plans normally.This requires no
adjustments to work as you are only using the
tiles or map as terrain.
Placing Miniatures
Generally, each space on the grid holds only
one figure.As most figures don’t take up the
entire space, you can move through spaces
containing friendly figures, but cannot end
up with two figures occupying the same
space. Note that this is a slight change to the
standard rules, which do not allow figures to
overlap or move through each other.
Moving and Measuring on Grids
For all purposes, moving one space on the
board is assumed to use 1” of movement.
Hence a character with a movement speed
of 5” could move 5 spaces. No difference
is made between orthogonal and diagonal
moves: Each move is simply counted as 1”.
Figures can move diagonally “between” two
spaces occupied by terrain.All measurements
are made by counting the shortest possible
route up to and including the target space.
A
B
A 4” move on the grid
147
Appendix II: Playing on a Grid
Lines of Sight on Grids
Lines of Sight are measured by drawing a
line between the approximate centers of
each space. Some flexibility may be needed
to avoid silly situations.A space containing
a figure cannot be seen or fired through by
either side.
Brawling Combat on Grids
To enter a Brawl, the moving figure must be
adjacent to the space of the intended target.
When using larger figures, you can place the
attacker overlapping the boundary between the
two spaces.The loser is pushed back 1 space.
Random Directions
To determine a random direction, roll a D8, if
you have one, or use a D10 and reroll a 9 or 0:
1. North West
2. North
3. North East
4. East
5. South East
6. South
7. South West
8. West
APPENDIX III: RED AND BLACK
ZONE JOBS
When your crew has attained enough fighting
proficiency, experience, and armaments, you
may find that the normal jobs do not hold
sufficient challenge any longer. Once this is
the case, you may apply for a Red Job license,
authorizing you to take extremely hazardous
jobs around the sector.To do this, you must
meet the following requirements:
• Have played 10 campaign turns or more.
• Pay a 15 credit licensing fee.(ABroker in
the crew can reduce the cost by 2 credits)
• You must have at least 7 crew members
at the time of application.
Once you have the license, when traveling,
you may opt to visit a world in a Red Zone. On
such a world, all missions are assumed to be
Red Jobs, regardless of their types.
148
AppendixIII:RedandBlackZoneJobs
Red Jobs
All normal game rules apply,including checking
if the opponents retreat due to a completed
mission objective.The following additional
rules apply when undertaking any Red Job.
Threat Condition
You must roll for a Threat Condition.This
is an additional factor that is applied to the
mission, regardless of its type. Not all of these
Threat Conditions may be applicable. Armored
Opponents and Elite Opposition only apply to
troops with certain profiles. If so, the result is
simply ignored.
ROLL THREAT CONDITION
1 Comms Interference: Each Reaction
Roll phase, roll one die less than
you normally would.A character not
assigned a die will act in the Slow
Actions phase.
2 Elite Opposition: All opponents with
+0 Combat Skill are upgraded to +1.
3 Pitch Black: Visibilityislimitedto6”.This
overrides any other visibility reductions.
4 Heavy Opposition: Increase the
opposing force by +2 enemy.
5 Armored Opponents: All opponents
with 3 Toughness are upgraded to 4.
6 Enemy Captain: Add an additional
Lieutenant with Combat Skill +2 and
Toughness 5, regardless of the normal
profile used.
Time Constraint
All Red Jobs are fought under a time
constraint.At the end of Round 6, roll 1D6 on
the table below.
ROLL CONSTRAINT
1 None: Nothing happens. Carry on.
2 Reinforcements: 3 additional enemy
arrive from the center of either neutral
battlefield edge. Pick the entry point
closest to a crew figure. One of the
arrivals is a Specialist.
3 Significant reinforcements: 3
additional enemy arrivefromthecenter
of eitherneutralbattlefieldedge.Pickthe
entry point closest to a crew figure.One
of the arrivals is a Specialist.Additional
enemies arrive from the center of the
opponents’ battlefield edge.
4 Count down: Roll 1D6 each round
hereafter. On a 1, the Battle ends
immediately.At the end of the next
round the Battle ends on a 1-2,then 1-3,
and so forth.If the clock runs out before
the opposing side has been driven off,
the battle ends and you do not Hold
the Field.You must complete your
objective before this happens to Win.
5 Evac now! The battle ends
immediately.You do not Hold the
Field, and you only Win if you have
achieved your objective already.
6 Elite reinforcements: A Unique
Individual and 2 enemy (one of
which is a Lieutenant) arrive. Place
them at the center of the opponents’
battlefield edge.
Red Zone Warning
Red Zones are high-risk places
intended to provide a substantial
challenge for players who are finding
the base campaign too easy.You are
likely to end up in a situation that is
unfair or very difficult to win without
significant luck.You’ve been warned!
149
AppendixIII:RedandBlackZoneJobs
Increased Opposition
• Do not roll for opposing numbers.
Instead, you will encounter a base of 7
figures + any modifier from the enemy
type encountered. No other modifiers
are applied up or down.
• Opposing figures will include 3
Specialists,one of which is a Lieutenant.
• Add +1 to the roll to determine whether
a Unique Individual is present.
Invasion Threats
• All rolls for Invasion Threat are at a +2
modifier, in addition to any normal
modifiers.
• All rolls for Galactic War Progress is at a
-1 modifier.
Improved Rewards
• If you Hold the Field, each remaining
crew member receives +1 XP bonus.
• When rolling for credits, you may roll
twice and pick the better roll.
• When finishing a Quest, you may roll
three dice, pick the best, and add +1.
• If you Win, you may make an additional
roll on the Loot Table after the battle.
You receive this roll as long as you Win,
even if you subsequently withdrew from
the battlefield.
Black Jobs
For the most hardened (or insane) of
crews, you can always chance a Black Job.
This involves being dropped into a near-
suicide mission on behalf of secretive Unity
government forces.You will not be considered
for this unless you have played at least 10
campaign turns in a Red Zone. Once you
have, you may volunteer for a Black Job at any
time. If you do, don’t bother looking for Rivals
or Patrons this campaign turn.
You receive a few advantages:
• Black Jobs are never subject to
interference from Rivals (no starport
scum is crazy enough to attack an armed
Unity drop ship).
• During a campaign turn where you will
accept a Black Job, you do not have to
pay any Upkeep, any ship loan does not
increase,and your ship cannot be seized.
• You may roll three times on the
Weapon Table in the “Loot” chapter,
and claim the items immediately.You
can keep them afterwards, too.
The Mission
You will always be facing an opponent from
the Roving Threats Subtable. Set up the
battlefield as normal. Roll to determine what
you are here to do.
ROLL YOUR DAY IN HELL
1-2 Destroy strong point: You must
reach the center of the battlefield,
then spend an Action and roll
1D6+Savvy. On a 5+, the charges
are set.Any crew member can
detonate them as a Free Action any
distance. Once they go off, all figures
within 1D6+3” become casualties
automatically and you Win.
3-4 Hold against assault: You must hold
out for for 10 rounds.You Win at the
end of Round 10.
Black Zone Warning:
This is not intended to be even
remotely fair. It is entirely possible your
entire team becomes casualties here.
On the upside, if you have a friend to
play with, you can team up and bring 6
crew members each.
150
AppendixIII:RedandBlackZoneJobs
ROLL YOUR DAY IN HELL
5-6 Eliminate priority target: Place
an extra opponent 6” onto the
battlefield from the center of their
battlefield edge.This is your target.
They receive Toughness 5 and
cannot be fired upon at distances
exceeding 20”. Once they have
been eliminated from the table, you
Win.They do not move, but may fire
weapons normally, if within range.
7-8 Destroy enemy platoon: You must
kill 25 enemy to Win.
9-10 Penetrate the lines: At least
two crew members must exit the
opposing battlefield edge to Win.
Set-up
• There are no Notable Sights or
Deployment Conditions in effect.
• You may still roll to Seize the Initiative,
and may even claim a +1 bonus.
The Opposition
The opposition will operate in teams of 4
figures. Enemies that have Specialists will
have one in each team.
When the battle begins, set up 4 teams at the
midway line between their battlefield edge
and the half-way point of the battlefield.The
teams should be equidistant.These teams
begin the battle Active (see below).
At the end of each round,another team arrives.
Randomly select a neutral battlefield edge,
then place an entrance point 2D6” down
that battlefield edge, measuring from the
opponent’s edge. Place the figures 1D6” on
to the battlefield from the side.These teams
enter the battlefield Passive (see below).
Active and Passive Teams
• AnActiveteamwillfightlikenormaltroops.
• A Passive team does not move or fight
during the round it was placed.At the end
of each round, assign a number to each
Passive team on the battlefield (just count
from left to right). Roll 1D6. If the roll is
a team already on the board, it becomes
Active. Otherwise nothing happens.
• Passive teams also become Active if
they are fired upon, or if a crew figure
approaches within 8” of them.
Ending the Mission
• If you have Won, you will be evac’ed out
at the end of the following round. Hang
in there!
• You can end the mission by fleeing
normally, but any crew member that
flees from the battlefield automatically
becomes a casualty, and must test for
post-battle Injuries.
Rewards
If you make it out alive but failed in your
mission, don’t take it too badly.You get
the normal post-battle rewards for a failed
mission, and Unity pays 1 credit for every
crew member who became a casualty.
If you Won, then congratulations.You can
claim all of the following benefits:
• Being favored and surrounded by Unity
friends (and given how well you’ve just
proven yourselves!), nobody’s going to
pick a fight with you deliberately. Clear
all Rivals.
• Add 2 Patrons to the list of Patrons
known.These are Persistent across
worlds.
• Claim 5 bonus credits. If you owe
money on a ship, Unity additionally
pays off 5 credits of your loan.
• Claim 3 rolls on the Loot Table.
• Claim 1 bonus XP for every crew
member you have, even if they did not
participate in the battle.
151
AppendixIII:RedandBlackZoneJobs
APPENDIX IV: PROBLEM SOLVING
Players inclined towards more complex
scenarios may set their figures an array of
tasks to accomplish: Doors that need opening,
computers that need hacking, and strange
alien animals that need calming.This section
offers a few quick solutions to handle these
situations as they arise. Pick whichever fits
your situation best. Such tasks and tests are
optional and will not come up in typical
play, being intended for creative players to
toy with.
Performing a test uses replaces a figure’s
Combat Action for that round unless the rules
or a scenario dictates otherwise.
Quick Test: Decide if the test is Easy or Hard,
then roll a D6.An Easy test is passed on a roll of
3+ while a Hard test is passed on a roll of 5+.
Opposed Test: Roll a D6 for each figure with
the higher roll prevailing. On a draw, the
action is unresolved this round.
Wits Test: Set a Challenge Rating from 2 to
7. Roll 1D6 and add the Savvy score of the
character. If the result is equal or better, the
test is passed.
Risk and Fumbles
Rolling a 1 on the die for any Problem Solving
tests above (before modifiers) Stuns the
character – they have injured or exhausted
themselves temporarily. If you deem a given
test to be inherently Risky, rolling a 1 inflicts a
Damage +0 Hit as well.
152
Appendix IV: Problem Solving
APPENDIX V: THE STORY TRACK
The Story Track is a way to plan a story arc into
your campaign. It does not replace the normal
campaign game. Instead, as you play, certain
events take place, forcing you to deal with
them.The Story Track is an optional addition
to the core game. It is recommended that
you wait until at least your second campaign
before employing it.
The Story Clock
Events in the campaign happen according
to the Story Clock.At the beginning of the
campaign and after each Story Event, a Clock
number is given.This is measured in Ticks,
which is an abstract time unit.At the end of
each future campaign turn, if you Won the
mission that campaign turn, the Clock counts
down 1 Tick.
If you did not Win,roll 1D6,and consult below:
ROLL TICKS
1 The clock does not count down
2-5 Count down 1 Tick
6 Count down 2 Ticks
If this reduces the number of remaining Ticks
to 0 or less, the next Event in the Story Track
takes place next campaign turn.
The Clock does NOT count down during a
campaign turn where a Story Event takes
place.
Story Events
When a Story Event takes place,it will replace or
modify the normal events of the campaign, as
explained below.Read the description carefully.
Each Event will also give the number of Ticks
before the next Event takes place. Remember,
Ticks only pass after regular campaign turns,
not after campaign turns with Story Events.
Some Events take place immediately. If so,
they are applied during the immediate next
campaign turn.
Setting up the Campaign
When you start the campaign, set the Clock
at 5 Ticks.As the opening of the campaign is
always a normal campaign turn, you will check
if the Clock progresses at the end of it.
153
Appendix V: The Story Track
Campaign Basics
During Story Event battles, you never roll for
Deployment Conditions or Notable Sights.
Sample Story Track
Event 1: Foiled!
The captain was excited this morning.A big job
lined up.Mega-corp,good benefits.Quite a deal.
Then it all went haywire.When you showed up
at the designated meeting place, hired guns
were waiting for you.What’s going on?
The Campaign Turn:
• OnecharactermustbesenttolookforaPatron
this campaign turn.Do not roll for success.
• DonotrollforexistingRivalsinterferingthis
campaignturn,andyoucannotTrackRivals.
The Battle:
You are under attack! Set up exactly 12” apart
with each side, in a rough line.All opposing
figures must be set up behind Cover, but able
to fire (such as at the corners of buildings, etc.)
You cannot attempt Seize the Initiative.
You will have to deal with 6 Hired Guns:
FromRound6onwards,if theenemyendaround
with 3 or fewer figures remaining,they will Bail.
• If you Hold the Field, you find that your
corporate contacts were murdered,
and your crew are being viewed with
suspicion, though you manage to talk
your way out of it.
• If you flee from the battle, you are
framed, and must add a Rival to your
roster,as the corporation decides to repay
the courtesy by hiring some hitmen.
• You will get paid normally (representing
some business deals your crew captain
makes behind the scenes), and may
receive a normal Loot roll, provided you
killed at least one opponent (one of the
enemy dropped it).
• A normal Rival check is not made.
The Story Clock:
Set the Clock to 3 Ticks.
Event 2: On the Trail
Your snooping around has paid off. Q’narr,
a smuggler and petty crook from one of the
disputed sectors: you and he used to be
tight back in the day, but he got a deal that
you couldn’t take.You weren’t angels by any
means, but it was too dirty, and you said as
much. He never quite forgave you, especially
since he almost got killed attempting the job
himself. Looks like he’s quite the big shot now,
and he’s decided to get even.

The Campaign Turn:
• You cannot attempt to Track Rivals this
campaign turn.
• If you pick up a Patron job this
campaign turn, it’s assumed to be a job
you took on to get closer to your quarry.
If you get attacked by Rivals, they are
attacking you en route.
The Battle:
Q’narr has hired a squad of Blood Storm
Mercenaries to cover his tracks.You’re going
to have to go in hard. Fight a standard battle
against Blood Storm Mercs from the Hired
Muscle Subtable.All normal rules apply, but
minimum encounter size will be 4, even if the
dice would otherwise indicate a smaller force.
• If you manage to defeat a mercenary by
Brawling, you have captured him and
can interrogate them for information.
Add +1 story point.
• After finishing the mission, you make
contactwiththepersonyouwerelookingfor.
The Story Clock:
Set the Clock to 2 Ticks, but the next Event
cannot begin until you have traveled to a new
world. Generate this as normal when you do.
Event 3: Disrupting the Plan
Your old friend is up to something big, and it’s
time to teach his people a little lesson.You’ve
found out where his organization is storing
contraband for sale off-world, and you’ve
decided to pay them a visit.
The Campaign Turn:
• You cannot Track Rivals or acquire a
Patron this campaign turn.
• You can be attacked by your Rivals. If
this happens, this Event is delayed until
the next campaign turn.
• One crew member of choice must be
assigned to plan the attack.This crew
member cannot take any actions this
campaign turn. If you are not ready, you
can opt to delay for one more campaign
turn, but after that, it’s go time!
The Battle:
Set up the battlefield resembling a camp,
factory compound, or similar. If you have
crates, boxes, barrels, containers, etc. place
them all over. If you don’t have these things in
your terrain collection, we can assume they are
just off-battlefield.
Scatter the opposition fairly evenly around the
battlefield, then select which battlefield edge
you want to enter from, and roll to Seize the
Initiative (at +2 if you Won Event 2, +3 if you
captured a mercenary).

Enemy within 12” of crew figures will act with
Defensive AI. Enemy that are not within 12”
of crew figures will first attempt to reach the
center of the battlefield. Once there, they will
change to Defensive AI.
To Win, you need to either Hold the Field, or
fight your way to the center of the battlefield
and plant a sabotage device.This takes a
Combat Action and requires a 1D6+Savvy roll
of 5+.If failed,the roll can be attempted again
by other characters, or through future Actions.
Once planted, the opposition will retreat from
the battlefield at the end of the next round.
• If you drive off every opponent, you can
just plant the device at your own leisure.
• If the battle drags on too long,
reinforcements will show up. 2 Goons
in each of Rounds 8 and 12 will arrive at
the end of the round, in the center of a
randomly selected battlefield edge.
• Rewards are collected as normal. If
you Win the mission, you may claim
an additional Loot roll from snooping
around the site.
The Story Clock:
Set the Clock to 5 Ticks.
Event 4: The Enemy Strikes Back
A direct attack on your ship, while docked
in port.They must have distracted starport
security. Now you have to fight for your life!
The Campaign Turn:
• Any Patrons acquired this campaign
turn will remain available in the
following campaign turn.
• You cannot be attacked by Rivals this
campaign turn.
The Battle:
Set up the battlefield as a starport with crates,
boxes, machinery, vehicles, etc. scattered
everywhere. If you have a starship model
that is to scale, place it along the edge of the
battlefield. Otherwise you can assume the ship
is located just off-battlefield.
Your crew is set up within 5” of your battlefield
edge. For this battle, you may include crew
members in Sick Bay, though they should
be marked with a token to show they are
Impaired.Any character marked as Impaired
can fight but cannot take Dash moves or Aim.
There is no Seizing the Initiative possible.
The forces arrayed against you are
considerable. Roll twice on the Hired Muscle
Subtable, and generate each enemy force
separately. Even if you roll the same type
of enemy twice, make sure they are clearly
separated into two separate forces.
The first enemy group sets up 18” from your
positions in a rough line with 2” between each
figure.At the start of Round 3, the second
enemy group arrives behind them from the
battlefield edge.You will have to fight off both
groups to come through this one!
At the end of each round, roll 2D6 for each
enemy group. If the roll is equal to or below
the number of casualties they have taken so
far, they break off the attack and flee.
• The battle ends if you drive off both
groups, or are forced to flee.
• If you flee, or the entire crew become
casualties, your ship will suffer 1D6+10
Hull Points of damage.
• If you manage to Hold the Field after
all, you may assign +1 XP to every
character still on the field when it ends.
18”
5”
156
Appendix V: The Story Track
You may also roll twice for Battlefield
Finds (p.121) Additionally, due to the
reputation you’ll gain from walking out
of this fight, you can remove any one
Rival from your roster.
• Do not check for new Rivals after this
battle.
The Story Clock:
Set the Clock to 3 Ticks.
Event 5: Kidnap
Not content with trying to kill you, Q’Narr has
gone after another of your old companions.
They’re out of “the business” and have been
living clean for a few years, but you just got a
tunnel-net message from his family, saying
they had been attacked by armed goons.
The Campaign Turn:
You will have to Travel immediately. Luckily,
you manage to slip away without any Rivals
having a chance to attack. Select a random
world you have previously visited, where the
kidnapping took place. If you did not keep
track, simply generate a new world instead,
and say it’s a place you had visited prior to the
campaign beginning.
If your ship is not fit to travel, or you prefer
remaining, you can take a shuttle.This will
cost you 3 credits, but you can only bring a
total of 4 crew members.The rest will take a
bit of shore leave.
The Battle:
• Set up a building in the middle of the
table, with scattered natural terrain.
• Place 6 markers, spread evenly around
the table, and place your crew at a
battlefield edge,not within 8” of a marker.
• No opponents are initially present.
When you approach within 4” of a
marker, roll 1D6 on the table below:
ROLL MARKER
1 Evidence! Signs of the attackers.
Record the Evidence for
use in the next Event.
2-3 Nothing Nothing here.
4 Body The corpse of someone
who worked here. If
you move into contact,
roll 1D6. On a 5-6, you
uncover Evidence.
5-6 War Bot! A concealed War Bot.
Speed 3” / Combat
+0 / Toughness 5
/ Defensive AI. 6+
Armor Saving Throw.
The Bots take no
Morale checks. Each
carries a Hand Laser.
• At the end of Round 3 and each round
thereafter, roll 1D6 for every remaining
marker. On a 1, the marker is removed.
• If you move into contact with the
location where it was discovered, roll
1D6. On a 6, you uncover Evidence (see
“The Story Clock”, below).
• The mission ends once all markers
have been revealed or removed. If your
crew all become casualties, remove any
remaining markers.
157
Appendix V: The Story Track
You do not get paid after this mission, and
obtain no Loot, but sympathetic locals will
offer you food, which will cover all Upkeep
costs next campaign turn.
You may make a Battlefield Finds roll as
normal (p.121).
The Story Clock:
The Clock is not set. Instead, at the start of
each subsequent campaign turn, including
the following, roll 1D6 and add the number of
pieces of Evidence you have found.
• On a 7+, you have found where your old
companion is being held, and can play
Event 6 whenever you are ready.
• On any other roll, you are still searching,
and will play a normal campaign turn,
but manage to uncover an additional
piece of Evidence.
Note down how many campaign turns it
takes to discover the location of your old
companion.
Event 6: We’re Coming!
You have managed to track down where they
are holding your friend. It’s time to have some
diplomacy, Fringe-style!
Campaign Turn:
There is no point seeking out a Patron this
campaign turn, and you will manage to dodge
any Rivals coming after you.
The Battle:
Roll once on the Hired Muscle Subtable
(p.121). Do not roll for the number of
opponents. It is automatically 5 + any
modifier from the enemy table.
• Determine Lieutenant and Specialist
type of figures as normal.There will be
no Unique Individuals present.
• Set up 2 basic enemy within a few
inches of the center of the battlefield as
sentries.Set up the rest halfway between
the center of the battlefield and the
enemy battlefield edge.They should be
in or near a central building, compound,
or similar, if you have one available.
• You will also need one extra figure
as the captive. Place them inside the
building in a spot that is difficult to see.
Your team will arrive from the opposing
battlefield edge, with each figure moving onto
the battlefield in Round 1.The enemies are
unaware of your presence at first, and will not
move or act.
• If you fire a weapon, or finish a Move
or other movement within 6” of an
enemy figure, the enemy is alerted, the
current round ends immediately after
the current figure has finished resolving
their actions, and you will now play the
rest of the battle as a normal battle.
• Shooting at an unaware target does
receive a +2 to Hit bonus.
• At the end of each round while
sneaking, determine a random direction
for each of the 2 sentries, to determine
which direction they will look in. Draw
a line from the sentry to the edge of the
battlefield (or until blocked by a terrain
feature). If the line passes within 1” of
a crew member in the open, they are
spotted and the enemy is alerted. If the
line passes within 1” of a crew member
who is visible but in Cover, or partially
158
Appendix V: The Story Track
obscured, they must roll 1D6+Savvy
and score a 4+ to avoid detection.
• When the alarm goes off, the enemy
will be confused during the first regular
round: They may Move (if no crew is
in sight), or remain in place and shoot
without Aiming (if they can see a target).
They’re Well-Prepared:
If it took more than 3 campaign turns to locate
the captive,the enemy have had additional
time to dig in.For each additional campaign
turn,they will receive one standard figure as
reinforcements.These arrive one at a time,

Place arrivals at the center of the enemy

the battlefield of enemies, additional
reinforcements will NOT arrive.
The Captive:
The captive is tied up, and will be left alone if a
gun battle breaks out, as the enemy troops are
under strict orders to transport him off-world
soon.If you move into contact with the captive,
and take a non-CombatAction to free them,they
can move and act normally,though at that point
they also become a valid target for the enemy.

Event 7: Time to Settle This
This is it.You’ve managed to track your old rival

chance than this.
The Campaign Turn:
• You may delay this battle for up to 3
campaign turns. If you wait longer than
that, the chance is missed, and you must

The Battle:
Set up two thirds of the battlefield as a barren

forth. No vegetation should be used. Set up
the last third with a large building, compound,
or underground facility. If you have floor tiles
from board games or roleplaying games, they
may come in handy here.If not,you can sketch
out some rooms and corridors on paper.
For this mission, your crew will be suited up in

• Additionally, as you are now known as
someone who repays their “debts”, you
can remove any one Rival from your
roster (or remove the next one obtained,
if you have none currently).
• If your old friend is still alive, they will
offer to join you permanently.They do
NOT count towards your Upkeep costs.
If you failed to free them, you find them
in the hideout, and they will offer to join
as above.

Appendix V: The Story Track
APPENDIX VI: COOPERATIVE PLAY
Solo games are well-suited to cooperative
play, where two or more players play on the
same team, fighting the foes encountered
by the crew.This can be done very simply by
dividing up the crew figures between the two
players. In a typical starting campaign, each
player would have three crew figures that are
“theirs”. Of course, nothing prevents you from
trading crew later on.
The following suggestions can be used to
guide play:
• Campaign decisions such as when
to travel, what to buy, etc. should be
decided mutually. If you cannot agree,
roll 1D6 with a 1-3 indicating Player A
decides, and a 4-6 indicating Player B
decides.
• Each player decides what campaign
actions their crew figures will carry out.
The campaign will be most successful if
the players agree on a general course of
action.Alternate declaring and resolving
a campaign action.
• When a new crew member is recruited,
they are automatically assigned to the
player currently controlling the fewest
crew members. If the number is equal,
the player with the most crew in Sick
Bay gets the new hire. If this is also
equal, agree or assign at random.
• During battle, each player makes their
own Reaction Roll and can only assign
dice to their own crew.
• When a Loot roll is made for the first
time, assign it to a random player.The
next Loot roll is assigned to the second
player and you then keep alternating.A
player may forego an item or give it to
the Stash, at which point it is commonly
available.
The above process can easily be adapted to a
3-player game as well.
For some players, the above suggestions
may be too stiff and restrictive. If the players
are in tune with each other, simply omit
any regulations that would get in the way
of enjoying the game, though it is highly
recommended that each player is responsible
for their own crew figures.
Appendix VI: Cooperative Play
APPENDIX VII: GAME MASTERING
FIVE PARSECS
What Does a Game Master Do?
While Five Parsecs from Home adventures
are usually created through random
generation, it can also be played with a Game
Master (GM) running the game.This works
closer to a battle in a roleplaying game, where
the GM describes the scenario, and typically
commands the opposing forces.This can be
combined with a conventional campaign
where you play a few GM’ed scenarios, then
play a few campaign turns of the conventional
campaign, going back and forth as you see fit.
Maybe an encounter gets you thinking that
there should be a connection, and you decide
to create a scenario out of it. Solo players
can still take advantage of this chapter by
essentially GM’ing themselves.Adding
something unique to your campaign once in a
while can spice things up, and strengthen the
story that your campaign is telling.
Scenario Ideas
• An arms dealer is intending to deliver
weapons to a rebel faction.You decide
to crash the meeting to claim the guns
for yourself.The battle turns into a three-
way shootout.
• An alien monstrosity is loose in the
corridors of an abandoned shipwreck.
Find it before it picks off the crew.
• The countdown for self-destruct is
ticking, but your crew has a whole
research complex between them and
the teleporter.The halls are crawling
with security Bots.
• The heist is a three-step job: Hack the
security systems to prevent an alarm,
blow up the entrance, and then make
your escape while the corporate security
troopers are doing their best to stop you.
• Your crew and a rival crew are having
a shootout. But it takes place in a
crowded subway station with civilians
everywhere, and if anyone innocent gets
shot, the cyber-cops will show up in a
hot minute.
Creating a Scenario
Any scenario essentially consists of two (or
more) groups that each want something the
other side doesn’t want them to achieve, and a
location in which this takes place.Typically, the
opposition is just there to stop the crew from
achieving their goal (security guards etc.).
but they may have their own agenda, such as
stealing things of their own, eating a few crew
members, etc.You may even have different
opposing groups that will fight everybody, as
well as neutral elements who just want to stay
out of it all.
The scenario needs a clear objective for the
crew to achieve. Usually this will be something
they are actively doing, though once in a
while it can be fun to have them be on the
defensive.
It’s okay to have a scenario where steps are
revealed (first they have to reach the computer
terminal, then they have to go to the armory),
but each step should be clear to the player.
Fumbling around until you find the magic
‘thing to do’ is rarely fun.
Each scenario should have at least one
element that sets it apart.This does not have
to be pages’ worth of special rules. Rather,
it can be as simple as a named enemy
commander with one or two unique ability
scores, and a single rule governing the
environment.
A more involved scenario with lots of chrome
can also be really fun, but the more special
rules you add, the more confusing the
162
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
scenario will become, and the more likely it is
the players will feel their choices don’t matter
as much.
In the end, remember that we’re dealing with
skirmish actions with 5-6 troops on each side.
Keeping it simple is often the best solution.
If you are linking scenarios together into a
cohesive story, they can of course get more
complicated and more involved over time.
Active Running vs Refereeing vs
Preparing
When GM’ing a scenario you have to decide
on the Game Master’s primary purpose. For
simplicity, the following three approaches
are valuable to understand, but, in reality, the
game rarely fits neatly into a single category.
Actively Running means you are conducting
the game much like the GM of a roleplaying
game: Responding to player actions and
letting the story unfold as the battle is played
out. Under this style, the GM often makes
tweaks and adjustments during a scenario,
whether to add a hazard to make the battle
more interesting, or to scale things back a
little if it’s turning into a massacre.
Refereeing means conducting the scenario
in a neutral fashion. Once the scenario is on
paper, you simply play through it.The GM may
still be actively playing, as a scenario often
involves hidden information, unexpected
surprises or traps, yet these may all be
planned in advance.
Finally, you may simply Prepare the scenario
so that it can be played by someone on their
own, similar to any other solo scenario. If you
are creating a scenario to share online, this is
typically the case.
Moving and Acting with Enemy
Figures
The GM must also determine if enemies will be
controlled actively,meaning the GM will move
and fight with them, or passively, meaning
they will act according to the normal AI rules
or a custom AI.If being actively played,the GM
can move and select targets as fits the figure
in question, scenario, and goals.This does not
change the round sequence. Enemies still act
in their own phase, as normal.
At the GM’s discretion, actively played
enemies may use combat options only
available to player-controlled figures, though
this should be clearly communicated before
starting the scenario.
Tools and Tricks
This section covers various tools you can
apply when creating a scenario.They are
not intended as the official, rigid rules for
handling the subjects listed. Rather, they are
offered as a quick solution that can be slotted
in without having to create anything yourself.
Advancing Plot Points
At times, you may wish to have things happen
behind the scenes or beyond the immediate
scope of the players’ crew. Examples might
include the sector government preparing
a military strike, an alien smuggler getting
off-world, the mad scientist completing the
computer virus, and so forth.
Write each plot point down. Some may be
known to the players, some may not be known
until they are discovered, or come to fruition.
Put a 2 next to each plot.
• Each campaign turn,roll 4D6 and advance
the plot one point for every 6 rolled.
• If actions took place that would benefit a
plot, such as a player mission, advance it
one additional point.
• If actions took place that would hinder the
plot,it is reduced by 1 and no roll is made.
• Any plot reduced below 0 is Foiled, and
cannot be completed.
• Any plot that reaches 6 comes to
fruition, and takes effect.
163
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
Note that despite the terminology, a plot does
not have to be nefarious. Completion of a new
starport, a fancy dress ball at the Governor’s
mansion, and completing the new paint job
on the crew’s ship are all valid plots as well.
This system can also be used for things like
investigations, searches, etc.
Booby Traps
Traps can be attached to a terrain feature,
an entrance point (such as a door), or a
specific action (opening a box, or accessing a
computer console).
Searching for a suspected trap is a Wits roll
(D6+Savvy requiring a 5+) made secretly
by the GM, who informs the player that they
found nothing (roll failed or there is no trap),
or found a trap (roll succeeded, and there was
a trap).
• A discovered trap is always disarmed
automatically.
• If a booby trap is set off, a D6 roll is
made. On a 1, the character manages
to avoid it or the trap fails to trigger.
Otherwise it inflicts a Hit on the
character that triggered it.As an average,
a Hit with Damage +1, ignoring Armor
Saving Throws, is usually effective.
When triggered, booby traps with an area
effect will strike all figures (regardless of side)
within 2”.
Bystanders
A bystander is a neutral character that has
no interest in becoming involved.They are
typically civilians, colonists, mall shoppers,
etc. and are there simply to add color or act as
moving scenery.
Bystanders act at the end of each round. If a
fight has not broken out, each civilian figure
will simply move directly ahead at a rate of 3”
each round.They will avoid moving into roads
unless there is a safe crossing point. If they
reach an obstacle, unless they have a logical
destination, simply turn them to face in a
random direction.
If a Brawl breaks out, bystanders within 6” will
immediately move 1D6” directly away, even if
this moves them into some sort of danger.
If shooting starts, any bystander within 6”
of the shooter or target, or within 2” of the
line of fire, will move 1D6” directly away, as
indicated above. Once shots have been fired,
all bystanders will Bail and will move 1D6”
towards the nearest battlefield edge each
round. Panicked bystanders will avoid outright
hazards such as chemical spills, but will
otherwise get out of the way of fire.
Any player that deliberately fires on
bystanders, or causes them to be struck by
Area weapons fired deliberately, receives an
Enforcer Rival automatically.
Complex Round Sequences
If a battle features three (or more!) groups that
all dislike each other, the round sequence can
get complicated.The simplest solution is to
have the non-player (enemy) round sequences
follow one after the other: All Quick Actions
are carried out, then each enemy force has a
phase, one after another, then Slow Actions
are carried out.
When you have multiple player forces that
are not getting along, take turns acting with
one figure at a time, clockwise around the
table. So, in a 3-player game, when the Quick
Actions phase is up, Player 1 acts with one
figure, then Player 2 acts, then Player 3 acts,
then Player 1 acts with a second figure, and
so forth.
Connections
When you carry out an Opportunity mission,
you may opt to roll for a Connection.This
option can also be used in a solo campaign.
Roll 1D6. On a 5-6, the mission is linked back
to a prior event.Think back on things you have
done before. Maybe you got hired by an old
164
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
employer,maybe an enemy is up to new tricks,
maybe it’s a favor for someone you know.
Connections don’t affect gameplay in and of
themselves, but can often suggest a scenario,
or a few tweaks to let a story unfold on the
table. If in doubt, roll 1D6 to determine the
nature of the Connection:
D6 CONNECTION IS
1-2 A person you’ve met
3 A place you’ve been
4 A job you’ve done
5 A faction or group you have met before
6 A personal Connection for a random
crew member (family, friend etc.)
If you are playing solo, a battle with a
Connection always has a Notable Sight and a
Deployment Condition.
Custom Enemies
New enemy types can be created for any
scenario, but often you can save time by
taking an existing enemy and tweaking them
a little. Changing the name can often work
just fine. Changing the weapon types (or
assigning specific weapons), or tweaking the
profile or AI type, is all that is needed to make
a new encounter opponent quickly.
Roll 1D10 on the table below:
Customized Enemies Table
ROLL CHANGE
1 If the enemy has a Panic range of 1-2
or higher, reduce the Range by 1.
2 The enemy adds +1” to Speed, +2” if
it is 4” or below.
3 Increase Combat Skill by +1 to a
maximum of +2.
4 Increase Toughness by +1 to a
maximum of 5.
ROLL CHANGE
5-6 Aggressive and Beast AI types change
to Rampaging.
Tactical AI changes to Aggressive.
Defensive and Cautious AI types
change to Tactical.
Others do not change.
7-8 Roll 1D6 for a special ability on the
table below, or add an extra one.
9-10 Gain a 6+ Armor Saving Throw or add
+1 to an existing Saving Throw.
ROLL SPECIAL ABILITY
1 Alert: -1 to Seize the Initiative.
2 Stubborn: Ignore the first casualty
when making a Morale check
3 Ferocious: +1 to Brawling, when
initiating.
4 Fearless: Do not test Morale.
5 Vengeful: Will become Rivals, if
defeated.
6 Invasion Threat.
Enemy Reinforcements
If a faction is receiving reinforcements, they
will have to be scheduled in some form.This
can be done in a number of ways:
• Arriving in a fixed round (or rounds)
• Arriving X rounds after a specific event
takes place
• Arriving if a die roll is made at the end
of a round (for example, 5+)
• Arriving if a die roll is made below the
round number
Reinforcements either arrive at Spawn Points
(see page 167), or from the center of that
side’s battlefield edge.They should arrive at
the end of the round, and may act normally in
the following round.
165
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
Environmental Hazards
The GM may wish to give a location
Environmental Hazards, such as a toxic pool,
a radiation leak, or a strange cosmic blur of
color that dissolves anything it touches. Each
Hazard has a Form,Volatility, and Effect (most
frequently, damage). Damage is applied
once per round to any figure exposed, at the
earliest point of the figure’s actions.
If needed,a random Environmental Hazard can
begeneratedbyrolling1d6oneachtablebelow:

on a D6 result of 6, then disappears
ROLL EFFECTS
1 Damage +0 Hit.
2 Halves movement speed.
3 Damage +1 Hit.
4 Damage +0 Hit. Ignore Armor Saving
Throws.
6 Damage +1 Hit. Ignores Armor Saving
Throws.
Intrusion
Any time the crew needs to get into a place
that is locked or otherwise secured, it is an
Intrusion.This can be an old-fashioned lock,
a computer terminal, secure DNA lock, or
similar.
The scenario should always assume the crew
has figured out a solution before the shooting
starts.To attempt this requires a character to be
in the right location, spending a non-Combat
Action, and making a 1D6+Savvy test.
The security system should be rated from 2-7,
which is the target number for the roll. If in
doubt, roll 1D6+1, but remember a rating
of 7 means a crew who all have +0 Savvy
ratings will be out of luck.
• A successful roll always bypasses the
system, though a very high-security
facility might have a second security
system that also needs bypassing.
The two do not need to have the same
rating.
• Low-security systems can be attempted
multiple times, unless a natural 1 is
rolled, which jams, breaks, or locks out
the system from future attempts.
• High-security systems can only be
attempted twice.
Rescues
If a character needs rescuing, they cannot
act in any fashion until freed.This requires
a character to move into contact and spend
a non-Combat Action. Once freed, they can
act immediately, and are considered to be a
normal member of their liberator’s team.They
must be armed by the liberators, as captives
typically aren’t allowed to keep their weapons.
The guards cannot attack or otherwise interact
with a captive until they have been freed, at
which point they can be attacked normally.
166
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
Revelations
The Revelation mechanic can be used to
add an unexpected plot twist. If desired, a
Revelation check can made after the battle, if
the party Held the Field.Alternatively, it can be
done if a particular moment arrives, such as
reaching a certain terrain feature, or coming
within close range of a particular opponent.
Roll a D6, with a 6 indicating that a Revelation
took place. Only one roll is made per battle.
If you are playing a custom scenario,
Revelation rolls are usually best left out as
they should already be connected to a larger
story arch.
The Revelation should be a big reveal that
changes the nature of what is happening.
Use the Revelation to inform new scenarios.
Solo players using this mechanic may use it to
gain +1 story point, and then acquire a new
Rival.This works well if the GM has prepared a
reveal in advance, but a D10 roll can be made
on the table below.
D10 REVELATION
1 A person you know is connected to
the job
2 You find evidence of a faction or group
being involved
3 A master mind is behind the enemy
you fought
4 The job was a set up to kill you
5 One of the crew remembers
something, or has a flashback
6 You find evidence of a large-scale
conspiracy
7 You find evidence of serious criminal
activity
8 You find a strange message, file, or
communication
9 You find evidence of government
involvement
10 A mysterious stranger was here
Searching
If a scenario involves trying to find something,
the location should be specified. Generally,
items are hidden within a terrain feature, but
not in a specific point on that feature. Larger
features may need to be separated into a few
“units” for this purpose.
Any character within or in contact with a
feature may search it as a non-Combat Action.
This is an Easy Task roll (1D6 roll of 3+),
but the roll is concealed by the GM, who
simply informs the player that the crew found
nothing (either because the roll failed, or
because it succeeded but nothing is there), or
that they found something (the roll succeeded
in the right terrain location).
If the roll is a natural 6, the GM informs the
player if they found anything, and tells them
they are confident they have searched the
feature thoroughly.
Spawn Points
A Spawn Point is an arrival point used by
a force. It can be a hatch where the crawlers
climb out, a teleport beacon, a door to the
interior of the complex, or a road leading
off-map, as the scenario warrants. Spawned
figures arrive at the end of the round, and
cannot act at that point.
If multiple Spawn Points are available, each
arriving figure rolls randomly to determine
the point on which they are placed.
If a figure is already present at a Spawn Point,
they are knocked to the side if someone tries
to arrive there. Multiple figures arriving in
the same round will always arrive at different
Spawn Points.
Spawn Points may be hidden in the scenario.
If so, they are not revealed until a crew
member moves within 8” and Line of Sight, or
an enemy arrives at one.
167
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
The Ticking Clock
To determine time progression, and when
something happens in the campaign, set
a number of Clock Ticks (see also p.153).
These can be a fixed amount or rolled on
1D3+2.The Clock counts down 1 Tick after
any campaign turn where the player was
successful in their mission.
After a failed mission, roll 1D6:
ROLL TICKS
1 No time passes.
2-5 Reduce time by 1 Tick
6 Reduce time by 2 Ticks
Time Limits
If a battle is fought with a time limit, you can
simply set the number of rounds. If the crew
needs to reach a location, make sure they have
enough time. Factoring one round per move
they will need, plus one or two extra rounds to
account for fighting, is a fair estimate.
If you want a random time limit, set a Count
(10, 20, 30, 40) and reduce it 1D6 per round.
Rounds where no fighting happens add +1 to
the roll.When the Count reaches 0, whatever
is scheduled happens.
Turrets
A sentry turret acts at the end of each round.
Turrets may mount a single or linked weapon
system (of 2 identical weapons). Linked
weapons are treated as a single weapon with
+1 Shot.
Turrets firing multiple-shot weapons will
attempt to hit the maximum number of targets.
Turrets can be fired upon normally.A character
in contact with a turret may hit it with any
Melee weapon.Turrets have Toughness 4
and a 6+ Armor Saving Throw.They are, of
course, unaffected by any Morale concerns.
Turrets must operate in one of the following
modes:
• Defensive Fire: The turret will fire at the
nearest target within 12”.All firing is
done with +1 Shot.
• Point Fire: The turret will fire at the
nearest target in sight.
• Priority Fire: The turret will fire at
a specific type of target (such as
combatants lacking IFF indicators, red
armor, Bots, etc.) within range, ignoring
all other targets.All firing is done with
+1 to Hit.
The Bigger Picture
The rules in this section offer additional
options for adding to the overall story.With
these options, there are few limits to the scope
of the science fiction universe you can create.
Factions
In an epic campaign, you may have multiple
Factions competing for power and position.
These can be criminal groups, governmental
agencies, private organizations, or anything
else you find exciting. Factions tend to exist
in the background of a campaign, struggling
and squabbling with each other.They make
excellent Patrons for enterprising crews.A
Faction should be:
• Powerful enough that it is beyond the
scope of the player’s forces.
• Interested in affecting the game world
in some way.
• Small enough that game actions can
meaningfully affect it.
Each faction is given a Strength (from 2 to 7 –
if you wish to roll for this, use 1D6+1), and a
Power (from 3+ to 5+; – if you wish to roll for
this, use 1D3+2).
Each campaign turn, a Faction may attempt to
do something beyond its normal scope, such
as starting a plot counter, taking over a facility
168
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
or business, abducting an individual, etc.This
requires a D6 roll, with the result equal to or
above the Power of the Faction to succeed.
Player actions may modify this by +/- 1.
Example
If the crew undertook a mission to sabotage a
rival facility, the Faction may be able to roll at
+1. If the crew failed in achieving an objective,
it may force the Faction to roll at -1.
Solarsystem-wideFactionsreceive2 suchActions
per campaign turn (during the Galactic War
Progress step),while sector-sized ones receive 3.
Increasing the Strength of a Faction requires
a number of successful actions equal to the
current Strength, which will raise it by +1.
Attacking another Faction directly is an Action.
If the target has equal Strength or weaker, it
loses a point of Strength. If it is stronger, it
only takes damage on a natural roll of 6.
A Faction reduced to 0 Strength is routed,
dissolved, or otherwise ceases to exist.
Mass Battle
The combat rules in Five Parsecs from Home
are skirmish-level, and while we could put a
lot of miniatures on the table, resolving the
fate of an entire nation is beyond the scope of
these rules. If large-scale warfare is going on,
this system can be used to resolve it.
Determine the number of battle-fronts
happening. Note that a front can be anything
you want to put on a map: A city block, a city, a
region of the planet, an entire planet or even a
star system. Be creative.Assign a Force Rating
to each side for each front.This should range
from 2-4 in most cases.A roll of 1D3+1 can
be used. In the event of a full-scale planetary
war, 2D3+1 can be rolled instead.
Each campaign turn, each battle-front will
resolve its fighting by rolling 1D6 per side.The
side with the higher Force Rating gains a +1
bonus. If a player mission would contribute to
the war effort, add a +1 bonus as well.
The losing roll has the Force Rating reduced
by -1. If either side rolled a natural 6, an
additional round is fought immediately
(regardless of whether the side rolling a 6 won
or lost). Battle-fronts reduced to 0 Force Rating
are conquered by the winning force.
Replenishing Forces
Each campaign turn, either side may receive
reinforcements.You may decide based on the
campaign story, or roll 1D3-1.These are bonus
points that can be added to any battle-fronts
desired. Each side may also relocate points
between battle-fronts, though low mobility
forces (foot infantry if on land) should be
limited to moving to adjacent fronts.
War Exhaustion
Usually wars are won or lost when enough
advances have been made, but if you need
a random resolution, assign each side a War
Exhaustion factor of 1, increased by 1 every
time a battle-front is lost.After each campaign
turn, a D10 result equal to or below War
Exhaustion means the side is Wavering. If
they were already Wavering, they will try to
end the war by negotiating, withdrawing, or
scaling down operations.

The Rewards
If the players are facing increased or unusual
dangers, they naturally need a carrot waiting
for them at the other end.A scenario does not
have to feature custom rewards – the standard
reward system will often work well, if the
scenario is close enough to a conventional
game situation, or was a bit on the easier side.
One way to add flavor to a scenario is to
specify that, instead of rolling for Loot, the
players will find a specific item, or roll from
a specific category of items. Of course, care
should be taken to grant them something
they will find valuable: going through hell
to get a single Stim-pack might lead to a
player revolt! A scenario could even be built
around acquiring a specific, desirable piece of
equipment, though the GM is encouraged to
ignore player badgering for specific weapons.
Conventional Rewards
Credits
At the end of the day, adventurers always
appreciate cash.Throwing a few extra credits
into the normal post-battle roll is a nice
gesture, especially if they were fighting a
wealthy opponent or taking on a well-paid job.
An award of up to 3 extra credits can often be
given without worrying too much. More than
that, and you should ensure it’s justified.
Another option is to grant discounts towards
things such as Ship Components, especially
for items the players do not already have.
Bonus XP
If a scenario is particularly dangerous or
challenging, bonus XP for the survivors is a
good sign.They accomplished something
beyond the normal, and have emerged more
experienced and hardened.
Generally, a scenario should not award
more than 1 bonus XP simply for surviving
or winning.Additional bonus XP can be
made available to a character that achieves
a particular task, such as completing an
objective, or eliminating an especially
dangerous opposing fighter.
Resources
Additional story points, Rumors, Patrons,
removal of Rivals and similar are all good
rewards that are unlikely to unbalance the
game.
Story point awards should typically be kept
to 1-2 additional points, but if a battle was
particularly tough, there’s a good chance they
burnt through a few points to make it, so
restocking them a little would be fair.
Quest Rumors can be awarded fairly
generously. 1-3 is fine.
When awarding Patrons, it is usually more
interesting to create a Patron that fits the
story, either by selecting desired results from
the Patron tables, or by creating a custom
quality for the Patron to have.
Custom Gear
A piece of equipment nobody else has is a
good way of getting the player’s interest,
whether it’s the goal of the mission, an
unexpected reward, or battlefield loot.Any
number of weird gadgets can be devised and
justified as Precursor tech, mysterious alien
artifacts, corporate black site experiments, etc.
New and cool weapons are always popular
with players. Start with an existing weapon
and tweak the profile, adding a beneficial trait,
or removing a negative one. Be careful not to
get too carried away or too dull.A Scrap Pistol
with +1” range is not going to make anyone
excited, while a Piercing, Critical, Impact Hyper
Blaster with double shots is going to make the
rest of the campaign anticlimactic to play.
If you want to introduce something
particularly cool, unusual, or special, you can
always apply some limiting factors:
• The item is usable only a limited
number of times.
170
Appendix VII: Game Mastering Five Parsecs
• The item is heavy and precludes carrying
other weapons.
• Whentheitemisused,itrequiresa2+roll,
or it malfunctions for the rest of the Battle.
• The item requires one or more rounds of
recharging after use.
• After use in a Battle,a 3+ roll is required,
or the item becomes damaged.
Itemscanalsobegrantedwithconditionstoresolve
before using them, such as being damaged,
or requiring research and experimentation
to figure out (typically handled with a roll of
1D6+Savvy: A 6+ is required to succeed, one
attempt permitted per campaign turn).
Special Characters
Allowing a new character to join the crew
is a great way of adding some flavor, and
giving the players something fun to work
with, especially if the Battle just cost them
a comrade.These characters should not
completely overshadow the existing crew
in skills and performance, but should be
reasonably on par. If in doubt, roll up a new
player character, then add 1 or 2 Character
Upgrades to them.
• You may opt to add a special rule or
ability to the new character, but keep it
modest.
• New characters should come with only
very basic equipment.
• To avoid Upkeep issues, the new
character does not count against crew
size for Upkeep purposes.
Campaign Rewards
Many rewards are intangible or relevant to a
specific storyline. For example, if the players
are working to undermine a crime cartel, then
the mission may result in one of the cartel
bosses being dead.They may have saved their
brother.The miners’ revolt may succeed (or be
crushed), and so forth.
These types of rewards work best when they are
combined with tangible rewards,or at the very
least the standard reward rolls after a battle.
Players who enjoy story-driven games will often
enjoy these types of rewards, while others will
prefer something more tangible instead of, or
in addition to, a campaign reward.

APPENDIX VIII: NEUTRAL
CHARACTERS
This section includes profiles for the sort
of average person you might find floating
around a starport, research facility, downtown
dive bar, or similar.They are included for the
sake of special scenarios, Game Mastered play,
and other such circumstances.We call these
Neutral Characters (NC)
All of these people have better things to do
than get involved in some morally dubious
space adventuring. In the end, if a player
wishes to request help, a 1D6+Savvy roll
of 5+ is usually needed.The GM can apply
a +/-1 modifier based on circumstances.A
natural 6 means the NC is so enamored with
adventuring life that they will request to join
your crew permanently as a PC, provided of
course they survive the excursion.
If a battle involves neutral characters as well as
enemies, add a Neutral phase after the Slow
phase.
A Reaction score has been provided for
characters joining the crew temporarily or
permanently.

- Character generation system
- Basic resource management
- Campaign phase system
- Save/load system with validation
- Error handling system with logging
- State validation with caching
- Phase recovery mechanisms
- Auto-save functionality
- Performance monitoring foundation

## In Progress Features
- Core Game Logic (85% complete)
  - Error recovery for edge cases
  - Performance optimization
  - Extended validation coverage
- UI Polish (65% complete)
  - Error display components
  - Recovery interface
  - Performance monitoring display
- Mobile UI (45% complete)
- Data Persistence (90% complete)
- Game Utilities (70% complete)

## Testing Status

### Coverage Metrics
- Character tests: 80% coverage
- Mission tests: 90% coverage
- Combat tests: 40% coverage
- Campaign tests: 30% coverage
- Equipment tests: 20% coverage
- Overall coverage: ~40% (Target: 90%)

   - ❌ Resource management tests (Planned)

3. Integration Testing
   - ❌ Phase transitions (Planned)
   - ❌ System interactions (Planned)
   - ❌ State management (Planned)

## Blockers and Risks

### Current Blockers
1. Test coverage below target (40% vs 90%)
2. Incomplete error handling in core systems
3. Missing state validation in several components
4. Incomplete phase implementation testing

### Technical Debt
1. Need improved error reporting
2. Require comprehensive testing framework
3. Documentation updates needed
4. Performance optimization pending
5. Mobile support deferred

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 1-2)
1. Complete test stabilization tools
2. Implement core system tests
3. Add state validation
4. Update documentation

### Short Term (Sprint 3-4)
1. Complete core systems
2. Add integration tests
3. Improve error handling
4. Begin UI component development

### Long Term (Sprint 5+)
1. Mobile testing
2. Performance metrics
3. Advanced scenarios
4. Full UI implementation

## Success Metrics

### Testing
- Test success rate > 95%
- Core coverage > 90%
- Integration coverage > 80%

### Performance
- 60 FPS target
- < 2s load times
- Stable memory usage

### Quality
- No critical bugs
- Complete error handling

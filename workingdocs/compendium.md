## Contents



**Introduction**

```
Welcome to the first expansion compendium
for Five Parsecs from Home. This book brings
together content from the first three rules
expansions – Trailblazer’s Toolkit , Freelancer’s
Handbook , and Fixer’s Guidebook – available
in print for the first time. This wealth of options
and updates for the core rules has been
arranged to group Character Options, Game
Options, and Scenarios & Settings material
together, and includes a combined Index for
both the core rules and this compendium.
In addition, this volume includes Bug Hunt ,
a standalone game and a military-themed
variant of Five Parsecs from Home , integrated
to allow characters to transfer between the
games for an expanded game universe.
Included for the first time is a nine-page
timeline for the shared Five Parsecs from
Home universe.

## The Path to a Compendium

One of the exciting things about developing
a game is having one vision of the journey in
your head and then, once it is in the hands
of the players, seeing them create their own
journeys. The expansion material compiled
here has always been about creating stepping
stones to that journey. Game design is a
question of multiple paths with each option
taken meaning another not taken. As you read
through these pages, you will see paths that
were not conceived of at the time, as well as
alternate paths to what was done initially.

When you bring these to your campaign,
they will help form completely new paths and
hopefully inspire your own creations as well.

It is a core philosophy of mine than an
expansion or advanced rule must never be
mandatory. Instead they should either add

```
more detail to a particular topic, more options
within the game system, or offer new ways of
doing things. If you paged through the book
before reading this, you already, you probably
already have something you’re excited about,
so go ahead and start there.
Of course, not every option is meant to be
used simultaneously: Firstly, some may not
suit your current campaign, and secondly such
a game would become unwieldy very quickly.
As a player, you can pick and choose what to
use and when to use it. The material on offer
allows you to do so at almost any time, so that
you may use one option in your campaign for
a while before swapping it for another.
As a solo game, the final arbiter on whether to
include any given rule is you.
Effort has been made to ensure that all the
options and advanced rules presented here
integrate, so that multiple options can be used
without too much difficulty. Included on the
next two pages are updated campaign set-up
and campaign turn sequences that reference
not only the new material, but when to deploy
the options, if you choose to.
With each expansion I have tried to showcase
both more of the world of Five Parsecs but
also more of the framework and how it can be
changed, tweaked or rearranged. Think of it as
a guided tour. I am excited to see where you
end up.

Freelancer News Monthly reports:
As Unity extends its reach, diplomatic treaties
allow for easy travel by members of minor
alien polities. Across the galaxy, Krag and
Skulker recruits join the already cosmopolitan
galactic community. Krag and Skulker crews
provide freelancer crew captains new options
while undertaking salvage operations and
other high-risk business.
```
```
Additionally, we are happy to report that,
after persistent lobbying, Unity regulators
are now allowing trained psionics to
perform freelance work. Interested
captains should fill out forms B343,
B-F343. and A42 (supplemental) to begin
the application process.
```
**Krag**

```
Krag are a species of short, stocky humanoids.
After their home-worlds were destroyed in a
cataclysmic disaster, many fled, while other
survivors have become expert asteroid miners,
scraping out a living in the remnants of their
home systems.
They can be found throughout Fringe Space,
either scouring for resources to send back
to the Krag diaspora, or opting to abandon
their doomed origins and embrace life as
distant traders, mercenaries, bounty hunters,
colonists, or more.
```

## Character Options


Special Abilities
Krag characters are subject to the following
special rules:

_- Due to their stocky nature, they cannot take_
    _Dash moves under any circumstances.
- Krag are famously belligerent and prone_
    _to getting into fights. When fighting_
    _Rivals, Krag may reroll a_ **_natural 1_** once
    _on either the firing or Brawl dice. The_
    _downside is that they often have a long_
    _chain of prior enemies. If the character_
    _creation rolls generate a Krag with one or_
    _more Patrons, you must_ **_add one Rival_**
    _to the list (regardless of the number of_
    _Patrons gained)._

Campaign Considerations

_- If a random party member gets into a_
    _fight or argument, it will_ always _be a Krag_
    _if one is present in the crew. Any such_
    _event cannot be bypassed or rerolled_
    _using Story Points.
- Armor acquired from a Trade table roll must_
    _be selected by the player to be Krag-armor_
    _or not. Krag-armor is designed to fit Krag_
    _only, although Skulkers and Engineers_
    _can wear both Krag and non-Krag armor_
    _without modification.
- Armor found from other sources will not_
    _fit Krag. Armor can be modified to fit Krag_
    _for 2 Credits (and reversed for the same_
    _cost), while doing your shopping during_
    _Post-battle Step 11: Purchase Items (core_
    _rulebook, p.125)._

Krag Colony Worlds
Krag colonies are rare. If you wish to visit
one, it will always have the _Busy Markets_ and
_Vendetta System_ world traits.

Adding Krag colonies to your known worlds
list costs **1 Story Point**. Once known, you may
opt to visit a known Krag colony during the
Travel Steps during any campaign turn.

```
Historical Background
While technically possessing enough
military and economic power to quality as a
Major Power on the Galactic scene, the Krag
were traditionally content to dominate their
own sector of space. Lacking expansionist
interests, and with a well-developed
economic foundation for mega-corporations,
they were well-liked as neighbors, though
they have been embroiled in wars with the
Manipulators on several occasions, typically
over trade rights.
It is not generally known what caused the
stars in six of of the seven Krag home systems
to go super-nova simultaneously. The Krag
refuse to speak about it to outsiders, and
Precursor predictors have failed to decipher
the signs and strands of the cosmic flow. The
result, however, was immediate: Overnight,
the Krag went from a regional superpower to
a species of migrants. Considerable economic
aid has been provided to the remaining Krag
colonies through both Unity and the Soulless,
but reception to new colonization projects
has been frosty at best.
```
```
Roleplaying Krag
While Krag belligerence was always a given,
losing their home systems brought this to
the fore. While Krag are quite loyal to their
friends, they often take some convincing to
win over.
They tend to value level-headed common
sense over more philosophical approaches
(which infuriates Precursors to no end), and
have a fondness for Soulless, finding them
easy to get along with. This has given rise
to the widespread rumor that the Krag are
expert crafters and artisans, though this is
an exaggeration.
They exhibit the same gender configurations
as humans. The species employed extensive
bio-engineering for further genetic diversity
in the past, but the loss of their homeworlds
has also meant a loss of the high-tech
```
## Character Options


```
facilities to conduct such engineering at
a cultural level. They are known to be very
accepting of bio-mods and uplifts such as the
Ferals, they have no specific enmity towards
bio-mods and uplifts (including Ferals).
Krag take to human languages with ease and
almost all speak SVIM, the Unity-approved
primary language. Many Krag apply for and
receive Unity membership.
```
```
Krag Miniatures
There is a growing number of space dwarf
ranges available online, though given the
variety in miniatures scales, any shorter and
stockier figure can be used.
```
**Skulkers**

```
Skulkers are rodent-like humanoids living
at the edge of Unity-controlled space.
While they only control a few systems,
they have spread far and wide, particularly
in the chaotic Fringe sectors. Skulkers
are the only organic species known to
have absolutely no concept of instinctual
prejudice, making them an easy hire for
space-faring missions where getting along
in confined spaces is required.
As their agility and flexibility allows them to
squeeze into tight spots, they are popular
as engineers and technicians on board
starships. While they lack the brute force of
the K’Erin, they also make for hardy soldiers,
and Skulker gun-slingers, sharp-shooters and
```
```
scavengers are a common sight in seedy bars
on Fringe colonies.

Character Profile
Skulker characters have the following base

```
Campaign Considerations
No special rules or exceptions are applied to
Skulker characters during the campaign.
```
```
Skulker Colony Worlds
There are relatively few Skulker colonies since
travelers tend to just settle in among existing
settlements. Skulker home worlds always
have the Adventurous population trait, plus a
second trait rolled normally. The Alien species
restricted world trait is treated as no result.
```
```
Historical Background
The Skulker home worlds are rarely engaged
in political conflict due to their isolated nature.
They have seen incursions from Converted
infiltration forces, but have so far been able to
repel them. Due to ongoing worries about a
larger-scale attempts, several treaties of mutual
assistance have been signed between Skulker
worlds and the Precursor and Unity polities.
When not pressed with an existential worry,
Skulker home worlds attempt to steer a
```
## Character Options


```
mostly neutral course, preferring to build
friendly relations without direct commitment.
As a result, official policy is to encourage
widespread migration instead of forceful
acquisition or aggressive expansion, which
helps avoid territorial conflicts.
```
```
Roleplaying Skulkers
Skulkers exhibit a wide range of behaviors,
but are generally viewed as gregarious and
easy to get along with. Traveling extensively
and rarely attaching significance to a
particular world, they view adaptability as a
cultural virtue.
The Skulker homeworlds are generally
considered quite safe, and isolated from
galactic threats. This, combined with the
rapid physical maturation of the species has
given rise to a very large population base.
As a result, Skulker society has developed
a number of techniques for peaceful
resolutions of interpersonal conflicts in order
to prevent wide-spread strife and unrest. This
has given them a misleading reputation as
being forgiving and easy-going: They merely
prefer quick, practical answers to conflict,
and are adept at compartmentalizing when
interacting in a social space, rather than
storing up grudges.
Philosophical and religious practices vary
widely. In accordance with their survival ideals,
they tend to view such issues pragmatically,
which has given their home worlds a
reputation for tolerance.
The friendly relationships between Unity
and the homeworlds mean Skulkers can
achieve Unity membership through a simple
application process. Many take advantage of
this option, as it eases travel considerably.
Skulkers have the same gender
configurations as humans, but lack any
interest in long term romantic relationships.
Liaisons are often brief, typically lasting no
longer than two years before the partners
drift apart or agree to move on. This
```
```
tendency tends to carry over to professional
commitments as well. A Skulker signing
a contract for 4 years or more is viewed
as deeply disturbed and a cause for
intervention by friends.
```
```
Suitable Miniatures
Any rodent-like humanoid will do, such as
rat- or mouse-based miniatures. As selections
among sci-fi figure ranges can be limited,
converting a fantasy miniature, or doing a
head-swap may be in order. Fur and skin
coloration can be whatever you like. As well
as natural animal colors, cosmetic gene-mods
are not unknown for Skulkers, so if you want a
space-rat with green fur, go for it!
```
## New Primary Alien Table

```
This table replaces the rulebook table if you
wish to include the new alien species available
in this book:

91-100 Swift
```
## Character Options


_The term_ **_psionics_** _covers a range of related
phenomena that allow mental manipulation
of the surrounding world. The Precursors
maintain this stems from an innate
understanding of the cosmic flow of energy;
Swift rely on ritualistic chants that affect
the sub-molecular vibrations of the world
around them (or so it has been explained);
others use drug or technology-enhanced
techniques to tap into and project extra-
dimensional energy._

_These energies, regardless of how they
are accessed and channeled, can produce
startling and tangible effects on their
surroundings._

Psionics can dramatically change both the
tactical environment and feel of the setting.
Games using psionics tend to feel more
space-fantasy, which might appeal or not,
depending on your own preferences. While
users of psionics (“ **Psionics** ”, capital P) do
exist in the Unified Space setting, they are
very rare. Even if you prefer the published
world, you are fully justified in omitting
their usage.

## Psionics in Your Crew

When creating a new crew to begin a
campaign, you may pick any one crew figure
to be a Psionic, noting any species restrictions
given below. Make the determination **before**
rolling up the rest of their profile. In other
words, you cannot roll up all of your characters
and then choose who is the Psionic.

```
Additionally:
```
_- Soulless and any type of Bot can never be_
    _a Psionic
- De-converted, Hulkers, Genetic Uplifts, and_
    _Bio-upgrades can never be a Psionic._
Once you have begun a campaign, any time
you acquire a new recruit, you may opt to pay
**1 Story Point** or **10 Credits** to have them be
a Psionic, provided you do not currently have
one in your crew.
**You may never have more than one Psionic
as part of your crew at any one time.**

**PSIONICS**

## Character Options


## Limitations

```
Due to a mixture of physical strain and having
to commit time to honing psionic rather than
physical skills, Psionics tend to be limited in
traditional soldiering qualities:
When creating a Psionic character, apply rolled
ability score increases as normal. However,
once the character is part of the campaign,
they are unable to increase Combat Skill any
further through Experience Points.
Psionics can only ever use weapons that have
either the Pistol or Melee traits.
Psionics lose their abilities permanently if
they are given any type of implant, even if it is
later removed.
```
## Psionic Power Determination

```
Once a Psionic has been recruited into your
crew, determine their powers. Roll D10 twice
on the table below to determine their two
starting powers. In the event of rolling the
same power a second time, choose either the
power that is 1 number higher or lower on
the table.
Precursor characters use the method above,
but may trade either of the dice for result 6
(Predict) , if desired.

```
Target self: If marked as Yes , the Psionic may

```
## Character Options


## Using Powers

```
When activated, a Psionic may perform a
Psionic Action as a bonus Action. Once this is
resolved, they may THEN move and perform
an Action exactly as any other figure. The
sequence cannot be changed, meaning the
Psionic must be able to see an intended target
when they are activated.
A Psionic Action allows the character to select
one of their powers. To use it, first select a
valid target, and then make a 2D6 Projection
roll. The power will project to a range equal to
the roll in inches. If the target is within range,
the power takes effect immediately. If the
power is targeting the Psionic themselves, the
power works automatically.
If the roll is not high enough to reach the
target, the Psionic may choose to Strain
themselves: Roll one additional D6 , and
increase the distance by the score rolled.
Straining your mind is dangerous. If the
additional D6 result is a 4-5 , the Psionic is
Stunned , but the power takes effect. If the
roll is a 6 , the Psionic is Stunned , but the
power fails.
Swift characters are particularly robust:
They will be Stunned on a 5-6 , and suffer
no other effects.
```
```
Psionic targets
In addition to any restrictions given in the
Powers table, targets must be visible to the
Psionic.
Psionics can see any target in line of sight,
even if partially obscured by terrain features
and can “see through” friendly and hostile
characters on the battlefield. Visibility
limitations due to darkness, fog, or similar will
inhibit psionic targeting normally.
```
## Psionic Advancement

```
In addition to the normal options for
advancement (core rules, p.123), Psionic
characters have the following additional
options for spending Experience Points:
```
```
Acquire Psionic Power (12 XP)
Roll D10 and receive the psionic power
indicated. If this indicates a power already
known, modify the roll by +/- 1 and receive
either power. If you have all three options thus
available, you are unable to acquire a new
power this campaign turn, but may save the
XP for future turns.
```
```
Power Enhancement (6 XP)
Enhance any psionic power of your choice for
an additional D6 to the casting roll whenever
using that power. Powers can be enhanced in
this way by only one D6 per power. Enhanced
powers can be boosted by Strain normally.
Remember that Psionics cannot raise their
Combat Skill through Experience Points.
```
## The Legality of Psionics

```
When using Psionic characters in a campaign,
World Generation Steps gain an additional
step after Travel Step 4: New World Arrival
(core rules, p.72):
```
```

```
## Character Options


If Psionics are Illegal
If Psionics are illegal, a Psionic does not run
any risk of detection unless they actively use
a power during combat. If they do, planetary
authorities (or another party interested in
suppressing psionic rights) may take action. If
a Psionic uses a power during combat, roll **D6**
during the post-game step **‘1. Resolve Rival
Status’** , and consult the table below:

```

```

If the indicated result is rolled, a band of

to determine the exact type:

Note on your record sheet that these Rivals are
Psi-hunters in addition to their normal type.
They are subject to the following adjustments:
```
_- Seize the Initiative rolls against them must_
    _be taken at a_ **_-2 modifier_**_.
- After generating the number and nature_
    _of enemies, add_ **_1 additional Specialist_**
    **_enemy_** _to their force.
- Psi-hunters add_ **_+1 to their attack roll_**
    _when shooting at or Brawling with a_
    _Psionic character._

## Character Options


```
If Psionics Draw Attention
If you are on a world where “Psionics will
draw attention”, there is a chance that psionic
usage will result in reinforcements showing
up. Every time you use a psionic power, if two
or more of the Projection roll dice show 6 s ,
the blast of energy has caused a stir, and the
enemy is going to call for reinforcements.
Reinforcements will arrive at the end of the
next round unless you have cleared the table
of opponents by then. Roll three D6 and check
each die for a result on the table below:
```
```
1D6 ROLL REINFORCEMENTS
1 None
2-5 A basic enemy
6 An enemy Specialist
```
```
Example: if the result was 1 , 2 , and 5 , the 1
results in no reinforcements, but the 2 and the
5 both result in a basic enemy, so TWO basic
enemy show up as reinforcements.
Note that it is theoretically possible to roll
three 1 s for the reinforcements. In this case,
while attention was drawn to the battle,
potential reinforcements thought better of
getting involved.
Reinforcements can arrive only once in each
battle, and arrive at the center of the enemy
table edge.
```
## PSIONICS

```
If you have chosen to include Psionics in
your campaign, you may choose to allow the
enemy to include Psionics. If so, determine if
an encounter features an enemy Psionic by
going through the steps below in sequence:
```
1. _Are you facing a_ **_Rogue Psionic_** _from the_
    _Unique Individual table? If so, they are_
    _automatically a Psionic, with_ **_two powers_**
    _selected from the_ **_Enemy Psionic Power_**
    **_table_** _below._

## General Psionic Note

```
Clever use of psionics can result in all
manner of interesting situations. Exercise
common judgement and evaluate what
the intended purpose of the power is. For
example, powers cannot be used to eliminate
figures by pushing them off the table.
```
## Character Options


2. _Are you facing_ **_Swift_** _or_ **_Precursors_**_? If_
    _so, a randomly selected enemy figure is_
    _automatically a Psionic with_ **_one power_**
    _randomly determined from the_ **_Enemy_**
    **_Psionic Power table_** _below._
3. _Are you facing enemies that are_ **_Hulkers_** _,_
    _any kind of robotic or cyborg type, or from_
    _the Roving Threats encounter list? If so, no_
    _Psionic will be present._ **_Add 1 additional_**
    **_basic enemy_**_._
4. _All other cases: Roll_ **_1D6_** _, with a result of_ **_4+_**
    _meaning a randomly selected enemy figure_
    _is a Psionic with_ **_1 power_** _selected from the_
    **_Enemy Psionic Power table_** _below._

```
Note that other than the Rogue Psionic, no
other Unique Individual can be a Psionic.
The selected figure replaces their normal
armaments with a Hand Gun and Blade.
If their Toughness would normally be a
4 or lower , raise it by +1 , as surviving wild
Psionics are usually pretty rough around
the edges.
All powers are rolled randomly on the table
below. If the same power is rolled twice, the
Psionic has only a single power.
```
## Designer Note:

```
The Psionics you will face off against are usually an extremely dangerous breed, possessing
wild and unpredictable powers. They do not use the standard psionic rules, although in a
Gamemastered scenario, the GM can decide which version to use for any enemy Psionics.
Note that you may opt to only use Psionics in your own crew and not use Psionic enemies
(somewhat easier campaign), use enemy Psionics without using them yourself (tougher
campaign) or both (the assumption if psionics are in use).

ROLL POWER NOTES
1 Assail When the Psionic activates, select the closest crew figure in sight and roll 2D6.
If the roll equals or exceeds the distance to the target in inches, the crew figure
is pushed directly backwards 1D6” and is Stunned. This may knock them off a
ledge or into/through dangerous terrain.
2 Reflect The Psionic receives a 4+ saving throw against any non- Area ranged attack. This
save cannot be negated by Piercing weapons. On a 6 , the attack is deflected to
strike the closest crew figure in sight of the Psionic.
3 Bolster All enemy figures are Fearless.
4 Slow When rolling for initiative at the beginning of the round, one of your dice is
automatically set to a 6. Roll the remaining dice normally.
5 Direct When the Psionic activates, the closest allied figure visible to them will
immediately fire if capable, receiving their full number of Shots. This does not
prevent them from firing during their normal activation. If the Psionic is unable
to see any allies, nothing happens.
6 Obscure Shots against the Psionic and any enemy within 4” of the Psionic
require a natural 6 to hit. Shooters within 4” of the intended target are not
affected by this rule.
7 Dominate When the Psionic activates, the closest crew figure in sight is targeted.
The target must roll 1D6+Savvy and score a 5+ to resist. If failed, the crew
figure will immediately fire their full number of Shots at their closest visible ally.
This does not affect their ability to act normally this round. If no allies
are in sight of them, the crew figure is Stunned instead.
This power cannot affect Soulless or Bot characters.
8 Crush When the Psionic activates, the closest crew figure in sight takes a
+0 Damage hit. If the attack fails to do damage or is stopped by Armor,
it does not Stun the target.
9 Paralyze All crew figures assigned a 6 when rolling for initiative cannot take any actions
this round, and are struck automatically if engaged in Brawling combat.
10 Psionic Rage All allies of the Psionic (but not the Psionic themselves) reroll 1 s when Brawling.
```
Additional Notes:

_- Enemy Psionics using these rules do not_
    _suffer from Strain.
- While the_ Dominate _power cannot affect_
    _Soulless or Bot characters, all other powers_
    _work normally.
- If the psionic becomes a casualty, all effects_
    _cease immediately._
       _- Powers that take effect upon activation are_
          _resolved when the Psionic is selected for_
          _activation, but before they have moved or_
          _taken any actions._
       _- If using the standard psionic rules for_
          _enemies in a scenario, they are treated as_
          _player Psionics for all rules purposes._

## Five Parsecs Minis

```
Five Parsecs from Home is proud to be a minis-agnostic rule
set, but if you prefer to use figures specifically designed to
replicate the species and enemies of the 5PFH setting,
a wide range of official 3D print miniatures, vehicles, and
terrain is now available from http://www.fiveparsecs.com

In the standard campaign, the foes you face
are generated randomly and do not generally
increase in challenge difficulty. In effect, the
rules present the universe such as it is, without
factoring in what you are bringing to the battle.
With this chapter, you can create a curve similar
to a video game, where the challenge increases
as you play.
Two versions are presented here: one that
does not require new rules other than the
table below, and one that takes advantage
of the new rules in this book. Under both
systems, simply tally how many missions you
have fought so far and apply the relevant
modifications applicable to the current
campaign turn.
You could combine both systems, but this is
likely to be deadly around Campaign Turn 20
or so.
```
## Option 1

```
This option is inspired by Lance McMillan’s
post on the Five Parsecs from Home Facebook
page. Apply both the highest Respawn and
the highest Strength entry that applies to you.
For example, if you are in Campaign Turn 10,
you would apply both Strength 2 and
Respawn 2.
If the table has been cleared of enemies, no
Respawning enemies can be placed. You win
the encounter.
```
```

```
The campaign game in Five Parsecs from
Home is built to be unpredictable, but fairly
easy-going on the player, both to facilitate
shorter campaigns and to avoid crews being
ground into the dirt from the start. However,
after a while you may find the game getting
too easy with an experienced crew, or you may
just prefer a tougher game overall. Below are
some options you can use to adjust game play
to a difficulty that suits your needs.
```
## Strength-adjusted Enemies

```
This option is useful if you want to avoid setting
up a battle just to fight two witless scummers.
Instead of rolling for the number encountered,
always assume the enemy rolled equal to the
number of crew you brought to the fight. Any
bonuses (from enemy numbers, difficulty
adjustments, etc.) are added to that number.
Example: if your enemy has a +2 Numbers
modifier from the enemy tables, and you
brought 5 crew , you will face 7 enemies.
```
## Slaves to the Star-grind

```
These options are useful if you like the general
level of opposition in the game, but you
would like money or progression to be a bit
tighter. This can better convey the struggle of
the scrappy underdogs trying to make it big.
You are encouraged to use both options listed
below, but they can be used independently.
```
```
Money is Tight
Upkeep costs change to 0 credits for a single
crew, 1 credit for a crew of 2-4 figures, and
+1 credit for each crew member past 4.
Taking Find a Patron or Repair Your Kit
actions costs 1 credit.
You do not receive 1 point of free Hull Point
repair each turn. All repairs must be paid for
unless granted by a random event or similar.
Whenever you would roll 1D6 for credits, roll
1D6-1 instead (minimum score 1). This applies
both during character creation and during
game play. Any modifiers to the roll are applied
normally.
```
```

## GAME OPTions


## Hit Me Harder

The following options increase the quality
of enemies faced, without increasing the
total number of troops to the table. You are
encouraged to use all four at the same time,
but you may opt to use only one or two.

Veteran
Select one basic enemy. They are a veteran
fighter and will increase their **Combat Skill** by
**+1**. Make sure you use a miniature you can
keep track of.

Actually Specialized
Enemy specialist figures have a minimum
**Combat Skill** of **+1** and **Toughness 4**. Raise
their scores to match if the scores are
currently lower.

```
Armored Leaders
Lieutenants receive a 5+ Armor Saving Throw.
Normal rules apply if they would already
receive a Saving Throw.
```
Better Leadership

_- The base roll to face a Unique Individual is_
    **_7+_** _, not 9+.
- For enemy types that cannot be_
    _accompanied by a Unique Individual, the_
    _roll is still made. If it succeeds, a randomly_
    _selected enemy figure has their_ **_Combat_**
    **_Skill_** _and_ **_Toughness_** _both raised by_ **_+2_**
    _(to a maximum of Combat Skill +4,_
    _Toughness 6)._

## GAME Options


## GAME OPTions

## Time is Running Out

```
These options help add a bit of urgency to
the battle, requiring the player to take a more
aggressive approach. The options can be used
simultaneously, but this might make some
missions very difficult to win.
```
They are Paying us by the Hour

_- When setting up, roll_ **_two D6_** _, pick the_
    highest _die and_ **_add 4_** _(for a final total of_
    _5-10).
- After the conclusion of this round, the_
    _only objectives that can still be achieved_
    _are_ **_Defend_** _and_ **_Fight Off_**_. Using this_
    _option, remaining objectives cannot be_
    _automatically finished after the enemy is_
    _cleared out._
    _Instead, continue gameplay normally until_
    _the objectives are completed or the time_
    _runs out._

```
There’s Movement all over the Place
At the end of each round, including the first,
roll 1D6. If the roll is equal to or below the
round number that just elapsed, one additional
enemy figure shows up. This means that from
Round 6 onwards a new enemy will arrive
every round.
Place the arriving enemy at the center of a
random battlefield edge (roll 1D6 : 1-2 left
edge, 3-4 enemy edge, 5-6 right edge). The
first enemy that arrives is a basic enemy,
the second is a specialist, with all remaining
reinforcements being basic enemies.
```
```
Fickle Scans
Any Notable Sight that has not been
investigated by the end of Round 3 is removed
from play.
```
## Starting in the Gutter

```
Use these options for the full “zero to hero”
experience. You can use one, two, or all three,
depending on what fits your story.
```
_- When creating your crew, begin with only_
    **_three Low-Tech Weapons rolls_** _and your_
    _choice of a_ **_Gear_** or **_Gadget roll_**_. You receive_
    _any items gained from the character creation_
    _tables as normal. You do not receive any free_
    _Military/Hi-Tech rolls, and do not receive the_
    _normal 1 credit per crew member.
- In a campaign with a standard crew size of 6,_
    _begin with_ **_only 3 crew_**_.
- Begin the game without a ship. You’ll have_
    _to scrape together the cash to purchase one._
    _See the “Getting a New Ship” section in the_
    _core rulebook (p.60)._

## Reduced Lethality

```
Of course, you may also want to make the
game less fatal. These options can be used to
make the campaign easier overall, or can even
be incorporated with the use of many of the
options in this chapter.
```
_- Before rolling for post-battle injuries, If you_
    _have two or more injured characters you_
    _may select one to be exempt from rolling._
    _They simply have a complete recovery with_
    _no Sick Bay time required. This option can_
    _be used for either a biological character or a_
    _Soulless or Bot at your discretion.
- If only one character is injured, you must_
    _suffer the result as normal._


## GAME Options

If you and your friends both have tough crews,
maybe it is time to face each other to see who’s
top dog!

These rules allow you to run the occasional
player versus player battle and integrate it
into your campaigns as part of your on-
going adventures. It is not intended as a full
“warband campaign” system where multiple
players are fighting for dominance, though you
could no doubt use it as a starting point. We
will refer to player versus player battles as PvP
in this section.

## Setting up a PvP Battle

You may agree to a PvP battle at any time. Such
encounters may come about for a number of
reasons: Pick one that you like, or roll on the
table below:

```
D100
ROLL BATTLE REASON
```
```
01-25
A chance encounter in the field
turns hostile.
```
```
26-40 The two crews were hired by^
opposing sides.
```
```
41-50
```
```
Both crews have jobs in the same
location, but one crew was hired to
clear out all contacts.
```
```
51-75 A long-standing personal rivalry^
flares up.
```
```
76-85
```
```
The crews have jobs in the same
location and the objectives interfere
with each other.
```
```
86-100
Each crew is after the same thing
in this location.
```
```
Player versus player encounters usually take
place in a neutral location, meaning not on
the world currently visited by either crew.
This might be a moon colony, orbital station,
starport back alley, abandoned ship, crash site,
or research station. The crews are assumed to
have arrived by shuttle and no world-specific
rules apply for the battle.
Of course, players may agree to travel to the
same game world from their campaigns. If
you are playing Five Parsecs from Home with
friends and they agree, you can always opt
to visit a world that any of your friends have
generated in their campaign.
```
## Before the Battle

```
Each crew will go through the normal pre-
battle campaign steps on their own, though
you should not worry about tracking down
Rivals or finding a Patron if you intend to play
a PvP battle this campaign turn. Rivals will not
interfere in a PvP battle.
The number of crew you may bring to the
battle is equal to the lowest campaign crew
size selected, though players may agree to use
more crew, if desired. Bringing 6 crew each
tends to produce a more enjoyable battle.
```
# PLAYER VS

# PLAYER

## Other Resources

```
Story points and “Stars of the Story” options
cannot be used in a PvP battle.
```

```
Note that you can agree to a battle despite
not being able to field the full number due to
sick-bay.
Example: If one campaign uses a crew size of 4
and the other uses a crew size of 6, each player
brings 4 crew to the battle, unless we agree
otherwise.
```
## Initiative

```
In PvP battles, you use initiative points to allow
players to push their troops further into the
heat of battle. Each player receives 1 initiative
point at the start of each round. During the
battle, an initiative point can be used to do any
of the following during your own action:
```
```
USE NOTES
Fire +1 shot with any
weapon and reroll 1 s to Hit
```
```
Spend before
rolling to Hit
Double Speed for one move
```
```
Remove all Stun markers
from a crew figure
```
```
Usable only when
that figure is
selected to act
Count a lost brawl
as a draw instead
```
## Power Ratings

```
To help balance things, we use a new term
called Power Rating to quantify how strong
each crew is. This is a rough estimation of
the relative combat capabilities of the two
sides. Each side will determine their Power
Rating, counting only figures actually fielded
in the battle.
```
```
FACTOR POWER RATING
Per figure fielded +1
Per figure with
+2 Combat Skill or above
+1 additional
```
```
Per figure with Rattle Gun
or Hyper Blaster
+1 additional
```
```
Per figure with 5+ Saving
Throw or better
+1 additional
```
```
Example: A figure with +2 Combat Skill and a
Rattle Gun would count for a total of +3 Power
Rating on their own.
Compare the Power Rating of the two sides and
consult the following table to see how many
additional initiative points the outgunned side
receives at the start of the game.
```
## Cinematic Game Option:

```
Players who want a more dramatic battle
in can agree to give each side 3 initiative
points to start with.
```
## GAME OPTions


```

## Setting up the Battle

_- Deployment Conditions are not rolled for.
- Each player rolls and places a_ **_Notable_**
    **_Sight_** _on the table. Note that Priority targets_
    _do NOT increase their Toughness upon_
    _discovery. Unless agreed upon, Notable_
    _Sights can only be obtained by the player_
    _that placed them.
- Each side determines an objective as_
    _normal, using the Opportunity Mission_
    _Objectives Table (core rules, p.89).
- Players will take it in turns deploying_
    _two figures from their crew, starting with_
    _the lower initial Power Rating. Determine_
    _randomly if ratings were equal.
- The roll to Seize the Initiative is made_
    _normally but, instead of the normal_
    _advantage, a player that passes the roll_
    _gains_ **_1 additional initiative point_** _at the_

```
beginning of the game. It is possible for
both players to succeed.
```
## Fight!

```
PvP battles use a modified version of the
normal round sequence.
```
_- At the beginning of the first round, randomly_
    _determine who is the First Player. You can_
    _represent this with any token you like. At the_
    _end of each round, hand the token over so_
    _the other player becomes the First Player._

Reaction Roll

_- The First Player rolls and assigns their dice_
    _as normal.
- Then the Second Player rolls and assigns_
    _their dice._

Fast Actions

_- The First Player must select one or two_
    _characters able to act in this phase (based on_
    _the Reaction dice they were assigned) and_
    _carries out their actions.
- The Second Player must select one or two_
    _characters able to act, and carries out their_
    _actions.
- Continue alternating until all eligible_
    _characters have acted._

```
Enemy Actions
If any AI controlled forces are present, they act
normally in this phase.
```
Slow Actions

_- The First Player must select one or two_
    _characters able to act in this phase (based on_
    _the Reaction dice they were assigned) and_
    _carries out their actions.
- The Second Player must select one or two_
    _characters able to act, and carries out their_
    _actions.
- Continue alternating until all eligible_
    _characters have acted._

## GAME Options


## Ending the Battle

_- Morale dice are only used for AI controlled_
    _forces (if any are present).
- At the end of each round, roll_ **_2D6_**_. If the_
    _roll is lower than the round number just_
    _completed, the battle is over at the end of_
    _the following round. Any objectives that_
    _were not completed by then will be failed.
- Note that players may agree to end the_
    _battle at the end of any round, provided no_
    _third parties are on the table. Any objectives_
    _not completed at that time are failed, and_
    _neither side counts as Holding the Field.
- Figures can be retreated off the battlefield_
    _edge during a battle, as normal._

## After the Battle

_- PvP battles never result in Rivals.
- Each crew is paid normally. A crew that_
    _completed its objectives receives the normal_
    _pay bonus for winning a battle.
- Battlefield Finds are not available. Each_
    _crew receives_ **_1 Loot roll_** _, with a bonus roll_
    _awarded to a crew that fought against an_
    _enemy with 5+ Power Rating.
- Injuries and Experience is handled normally,_
    _and crews receive campaign and character_
    _events as usual._

## The Three-way Battle!

```
This system can be used with a neutral third
party without too much difficulty, though this
works best if you are playing in a considerate
and friendly manner when AI questions come
up. A third player or GM is ideal for handling
the intruders.
Roll up the enemy as normal, and deploy
them along a neutral battlefield edge. They
should not begin within 12” of figures from
either crew, and should be placed as evenly as
possible.
They will act normally, selecting all targets
based on their AI. The third party does not
distinguish between the two crews, treating
them as one force for the purposes of any
target selection. As players are likely to gang
up on the third party, add +1 basic enemy
and +1 specialist to the number normally
encountered.
The third party is always accompanied by a
Unique Individual , unless they are from the
Roving Threat Encounter Table.
If you would like to randomize the presence of
a third party, roll D100 on the table below.
While a third-party force is present on the
battlefield, players may not agree to end the
battle prematurely, though a player could
retreat off the battlefield edge as normal.
```
```
D100 THIRD PARTY
1-40 Deployed on neutral battlefield edge
41-60 As above, but add +1 specialist and +1 Lieutenant
61-70 Deployed within 6" of the center of the battlefield
71-80 Arrives at the start of Round 3 from a randomly selected neutral battlefield edge
```
```
81-90
At the start of the game, roll 1D6. At the beginning of the round equal to the die roll,
the enemy arrives from a randomly selected neutral battlefield edge.
```
```
91-100
Deployed on neutral battlefield edge. At the start of Round 3, 1D6 additional basic enemies
arrive from the same battlefield edge. If 5-6 arrive, one will be a specialist.
```
## GAME OPTions


## The Job

A co-op battle allows two crews to team up
on the an epic mission against strengthened
opposition. Such missions are usually
Opportunity or Invasion battles, though
see the options for Rivals below. Patron and
Quest missions are specific to a single crew
and cannot be played as co-op by default
(though you could house-rule this if you are
eager to do so).

## The Location

The location of a co-op battle can be
determined in the following ways:

_- You may agree that the battle takes place on_
    _any neutral ground, such as a moon base,_
    _frontier colony, orbital station, or similar._
    _In this case, no World traits will apply. The_
    _two crews are assumed to rely on shuttle_
    _transport to get to the location.
- Alternatively, you may agree to play the_
    _encounter on a specific world that exists in_
    _either campaign. If your friends are playing_
    **_Five Parsecs from Home_** _, you may always_
    _opt to travel to a world they are currently on._
    _This uses the normal rules for travel, but_
    _you do not roll for licensing or World_
    _traits. Instead you will automatically apply_
    _the same conditions already established_
    _when the world was established in the first_
    _player’s campaign.
- A newly created crew can also simply choose_
    _to begin their campaign on a world in a_
    _friend’s campaign._

```
To play an Opportunity battle, simply agree to
do so during this campaign turn. Neither player
will be attacked by Rivals while pursuing a
co-op battle (but see below). Note: As jobs can
take place off-world, you may agree to play a
co-op Opportunity battle even if you are not on
the same world. If so, assume both crews have
shuttled to the location (a moon, space station,
or similar). No World traits will be in effect.
If you have previously agreed that you are on
the same world and an Invasion takes place,
each crew will have to flee, but you may agree
to fight the Invasion battle together.
```
## Rivals

```
If both crews have Rivals, you may instead opt
to have a showdown against a coalition of your
enemies. Each crew should randomly select
one of their Rivals. The two selected Rivals have
decided to team up to take you on.
```
## Objectives and Conditions

```
If fighting against Rivals or an Opportunity
mission, a Deployment Condition is rolled
up normally (see core rules, p.88). Roll twice
on the Notable Sights Table, placing one
item 1D6+3” to the left of the center of the
battlefield, and the other item 1D6+3” to the
right of the center.
The objective is always to Fight Off your
opponents: To Win, at least one crew member
must Hold the Field. Against Rivals, treat this
as a Showdown (a straight-up fight, with no
modifications).
```
# EXPANDED

# CO-OP

# BATTLES

## GAME Options


## The Enemy

```
Each player rolls up an enemy type as normal;
you will face both of these enemies. If fighting
Rivals, you will face an enemy force from each
Rival type.
```
_- Generate each force as normal, but increase_
    _the number faced by_ **_+2_**_.
- Label the numerically larger force as Wave 1_
    _and the second as Wave 2. If they are equal,_
    _randomize which is which.
- Generate_ **_one additional Unique_**
    **_Individual_** _, and add them to Wave 2.
- These two waves are the known opposition._

## Initial Deployment

```
Co-op battles are best played on a 3-foot
square battlefield to allow the battle a little
more space to unfold. If using the terrain
guidelines on p.109 of the core rulebook,
place 4 large , 6 small , and 4 linear terrain
items to make the battlefield a bit more
cluttered than normal.
Forces should set up no closer than 24” apart.
Set up the Wave 1 enemies first, then place the
crew figures. The two crews set up on the same
battlefield side, but must be separated by at
least 8”.
There is no roll to Seize the Initiative.
```
## Fighting the Battle

```
The two crews are considered to be a single
force for the duration of the battle. When a
round begins, each player rolls for Reactions
and assigns their dice normally. The dice pools
are kept separate. In each of the Quick Actions
and Slow Actions phases, the two players take it
in turns to select and act with an eligible figure,
starting with the player who has the fewest
figures to use in that phase.
Enemies act in the Enemy Actions phase,
according to the normal rules.
```
```
Wave 2 Arrival
At the beginning of Round 3 , before Reaction
dice are rolled, the second wave arrives. Roll
1D6 : On a 1-2 they are placed along the left
battlefield edge, on a 3-4 they are placed along
the enemy battlefield edge, on a 5-6 they are
placed along the right battlefield edge.
They will set up within 4” of the center of the
selected edge.
```
```
Wave 3 Arrival
Roll 2D6 at the end of every round, starting
with Round 3. If the combined roll is below the
round number just finished, it turns out the
enemy has brought additional forces.
Roll up a new force using the Hired Muscle
enemy tables (core rules, p.96). Add one
additional specialist figure. A roll for Unique
Individuals is not made: the third wave is
automatically accompanied by one.
Roll 1D6 to determine where this force arrives
from: On a 1-2 , they are placed along the left
battlefield edge, on a 3-4 , they arrive from the
player’s battlefield edge behind them, on a
5-6 , they are placed along the right battlefield
edge. If rolling the same battlefield edge used
by Wave 2, the third wave is placed on the
opposite battlefield edge.
```
```
Make it Quick
From the end of Round 6 onwards, if the table
is completely cleared of enemy forces, the
game ends even if Wave 3 has not yet arrived.
```
```
Setting Notes
You may end up with forces that are not
compatible with each other in the Unified
Space setting. For example, nobody would
willingly work with the Converted. You may
opt to resolve these questions any way you
like (the non-Converted force are actually
infiltration cyborgs), or swap out one of the
enemy forces to fit better. This is left up to the
players to decide.
```
## GAME OPTions


## Tough Fight

Opponents are always counted as having a
**Panic range of 1** , meaning they will only
flee if a **1** is rolled on the Morale dice. Each
enemy Wave is considered separate for Morale
purposes. For example, casualties in Wave 1
only cause Morale dice to be rolled for Wave 1.

Opponents with _Cautious_ or _Defensive_ AI are
treated as _Tactical_ AI instead.

## The Aftermath

As long as at least one crew figure Holds the
Field, both crews are assumed to have done so
and Won. All remaining steps are conducted
normally except for the following:

Resolve Rival Status
This step is conducted normally.

Get Paid
Each crew receives +1 when rolling for credits.

Battlefield Finds
Each crew may roll on the table.

```
Check for Invasion!
Make this check if any of the enemies faced
were an Invasion Threat. Roll once, adding
+1 per enemy Wave that had the Invasion
Threat trait.
```
```
Gather the Loot
Each crew rolls a Loot item as normal. One
player makes an additional Loot roll , with
both crews obtaining this item.
```
## Notes and Variants

```
Separate Enemy Teams
Campaign difficulty and crew size adjustments
may be applied to each of the two initial forces
individually. In effect, each player rolls up their
own enemy, which is then placed as Wave 1
and 2 respectively.
```
```
Increased Challenge
If you want a greater challenge, add one
additional Lieutenant to Waves 1 and 2, then
add two additional basic enemies to Wave 3.
```
## GAME Options


```
The default AI is diceless to keep the game
moving as quickly as possible. If you prefer a
less predictable battle environment, you can
use this system to determine enemy actions.
Using these rules, enemies with the Beast ,
Rampage , and Guardian AIs function as they
would currently. No changes are made.
```
## How to Use the New AI

Impossible or Stupid Actions
The system may suggest an action that is
impossible to carry out or which would make
no sense in the current context of the game.
In such circumstances, the player will have to
inject some logic. After all, enemies will not
wander off cliff-sides or charge into lava pools.
If in doubt, the figure will remain in place and
fire at a visible target.

Notes:
“Next forward position” means the next Cover
or terrain feature that is closer to the player’s
side and in front of the figure in question.
“Use Cover” means the figure will attempt to
remain in Cover or out of sight. A move in the
open will be done by Dashing if it will bring
the figure into Cover. The figure will only end a
move out of Cover if the end of the move is not
in sight of player figures.
“Maneuver within Cover” means the figure
will move within or behind the current terrain
feature in order to get the best shot possible
(preferring targets in the open over targets in
Cover). If the figure is not in Cover currently, it
will move to find Cover, Dashing if needed.

With this system, the enemy will frequently
set up in a way that befits a more cunning
opposition force: Attempting to outflank you,
sneaking up on you, or bursting out from
where you least expect it during the mission.
This both provides a greater challenge and
makes scenarios more unpredictable.
```

(p.110) still applies as normal when
determining how individual enemy figures are
placed relative to each other.
When placing figures arriving from
concealment or infiltration, they should be
placed anywhere within or directly behind the
feature that would permit them to fire on at
least one crew member.

This option caters to a more cinematic
experience when fighting a battle. As you
engage with the enemy forces and push
them back, they will fight back harder, bring
up reinforcements, or rush forward to storm

At the end of each round during combat, you
will carry out an Escalation check if any of the
following things happened during the round
just completed:
```
_- Any enemy figures were removed_
    _from play
- A crew member reached an objective
- At the end of_ **_Round 1_** _, if the enemy is_
    _currently outnumbered by 3 or more._

## Variation Mode (Optional Rule)

```
If you prefer more variation, apply the
following rule: If you roll an Escalation
result that has already happened during
the current battle, ignore it and count
it as no result. However, his does NOT
count as one of the three possible
escalations during a battle.
```
## GAME Options


```
An experienced crew loaded up with modded
guns will eventually outshoot the scummers
and pirate rabble they encounter in Fringe
Space as a matter of routine. Once you know
you’re top dog, it’s time to kick things up a
notch with elite-level enemies.
These updated enemy tables take the place
of the regular encounter tables in the core
rulebook. They contain the same types of
enemies, so if you already have models that
you like to use for nomads or mercenaries,
you can keep on using them. Instead, these
tables focus on beefing up the opposition and
making them stronger, better armed, and more
devious. Along with stronger foes, you will also
get slightly improved rewards after the battle,
making it a more worthwhile prospect.
While the core rulebook encounters lean
towards being leniency, these aim to be
tougher. If you are getting trounced, focus on
the objective and get out of there!
It is up to you when to “graduate” to these
tougher enemies in your campaign. If you feel
encounters have become a bit too predictably
easy or you win several fights with no casualties,
it is probably time to consider it. Of course, as
many players enjoy a brutal fight, you may also
simply choose to start here. Should you prefer a
more gradual approach, you could add a die roll
for each encounter. A D6 result of a 4+ might
indicate an Elite opponent. You are welcome to
swap back and forth as well. You may want to
use the updated versions of some enemies, but
not others, or use the Elite-level special rules for
a new version with the old stats (or vice versa).
```
## Principles

```
When creating these updated tables, a few core
principles were kept in mind:
```
_- Avoiding the temptation to flood the table_
    _with bad guys. While most of the encounters_
    _do raise the numbers compared to the core_
    _rulebook (and in a few cases, dramatically_
    _so), I wanted to avoid people having to paint_
    _huge hordes of models to play with these_
    _new lists. In most cases, where encounter size_
    _has increased, it has done so by 1-2 figures.
- Upgrading foes to feel actively mean,_
    _making life more difficult for your crew._
    _If you play these encounters and end up_
    _shaking your fist at me, that could be called_
    _a job well done!
- Applying variations to how dangerous_
    _the upgrades are. While all enemies are_
    _upgraded, there are still distinct differences_
    _in how dangerous these upgrades are;_
    _some will be seriously dangerous while_
    _others are only slight adjustments_
    _compared to the original versions._

```
Complexity
These encounter tables do feature more
special rules than the regular versions. As
players moving to these are assumed to
be experienced with the game system, this
should not be too much of a shock. Review
each encounter carefully as some of the new
rules apply during the set-up sequence.

## Elite-level Rivals

Elite-level enemies are more persistent. When
traveling to a new world, roll **1D6** for each Elite
Rival you have: On a **4+** they opt to follow you
to the new world.

## Elite Composition

When facing elite-level enemies, roll up their
size as normal. If the size would be less than
4 figures, increase it to **4**. The opposing force is
comprised as shown on the table above:

Basic Enemies

_- Armed with the basic weapon for their type._

    _plus a_ **_Ripper Sword_**_.
-_ **_Combat Skill_** _is increased by_ **_+1_**_.
-_ **_Fearless_**_.
- If_ **_Toughness_** _is less than 5, increase it to_ **_5_**_._
    _If the character is normally armored,_
    _increase their_ **_Armor Saving Throw_** _by_ **_+1_**_._
    _Otherwise add a_ **_5+ Armor Saving Throw_**_._

```
Unique Individuals
If you outnumber the enemy, they are
automatically accompanied by a Unique
Individual. If you do not outnumber them,
roll normally, but a 7+ is required instead of
the usual 9+.
```
```
Leadership
While Lieutenants or Captains are present,
enemy Morale is improved according to the
table below. Use the highest rank present:
A Panic range of 0 indicates the enemy is
Fearless , unless another modifier raises the
Panic range.
These bonuses only apply as long the character
in question is on the battlefield.
```
```
LEADERSHIP NORMAL PANIC RANGE MODIFIED PANIC RANGE
Lieutenant 1-3 1-2
Lieutenant 1-2 1
Lieutenant 1 1
Captain 1-3 1
Captain 1-2 1
Captain 1 0
```
## GAME Options


## Enemy Weapon Notes

```
In some cases, enemies may carry more than
one ranged weapon. For AI purposes, ignore
this while moving; as long as the enemy is
in range of one of their weapons, the AI is
satisfied it is in range. If both weapons are in
range, it will opt for the weapon with the most
shots first, highest damage second, unless
specifics are stated otherwise.
Some enemy profiles will state that they
replace specific weapons. Roll for their
armaments normally. If one of the weapons
generated is listed in the enemy profile as
being replaced, they will carry the replacement
weapon instead.
For example, if the profile states that they
replace all Scrap Pistols with Handguns, this
change happens if you roll Scrap Pistols on the
weapons table. Otherwise, nothing happens.
```
## Elite-level Rewards

```
While facing off against Elite-level enemies is
primarily a question of a tougher challenge,
it is only fair that greater rewards follow.
However, after fighting Elite-level enemies, the
following rewards are designed to be modest
improvements over standard rewards. A crew
so tough they are handling these foes need
little additional reward beyond the respect of
other crew captains!
```
```
Better Loot
When rolling for Loot , you may make one
additional roll beyond the usual amount
allowed, then select which one of the rolled
```
```
items you do not receive. This means you
would typically roll twice and pick either
result. If you were allowed two items normally,
you would roll three times and pick two, and
so forth.
```
```
Patron Pay
Any Patron job will pay +1 credit in additional
Danger Pay (see p.83 of the core rulebook),
as long as you manage to kill at least one
opponent.
```
```
Quest Rewards
If finishing a Quest, you receive one
additional Loot item.
```
```
Brutal Fight
If your entire crew are casualties in a battle,
select one crew member of your choice that
receives +1 XP.
```
## Elite-level Enemy Tables

```
When facing an elite-level enemy, use the
updated tables in place of the tables in the
core rulebook.
```
```
Elite Criminal Elements
You are facing some sort of outlawed enterprise
or faction.
```
_-_ **_Bounty pay:_** _When engaging any_
    _opponents from this list, there is an_
    _increased chance of a bounty being_
    _available. When setting up, roll_ **_1D6_**_. If the_
    _score is_ **_1-3_** _, that is the number of bonus_
    _credits paid out if you Hold the Field after_
    _the battle.
-_ **_Gang feuds:_** _Career criminals also tend to_
    _get even. When rolling to see if a defeated_
    _criminal group becomes a Rival, you must_
    _roll_ **_2D6_** _, with a_ **_1_** _on either die indicating_
    _that you have acquired them as Rivals. If_
    _both dice score a_ **_1_** _, they hate you; they_
    _become Rivals AND will increase the_
    _numbers encountered by_ **_+1_** _in all battles._

## Rules Conflicts

```
Note: If there is a conflict between this
expansion and the core rulebook, this
expansion takes precedence regarding Elite-
level enemies. You may, of course, house-rule
any other answer to suit your campaign.

moves a full move directly towards the shooter, attempting to engage them in a brawl. This can
only happen once per weapon attack, and resolves after all shots from the attacker are resolved.
```

62-65 Precursor Wanderer 7" +2 4 A 1
Infantry Laser,
Glare Sword
An alien mystic, brimming with psionic energies.
One with the flow: When activated normally, the Wanderer fires their weapon immediately, then
moves and then fires a second time.

be taken (and another target cannot be selected), and the Wanderer immediately takes a half
move and then fires once at the would-be attacker.
66-69 Hakshan Investigator 5" +1 4 D 1 Plasma Rifle

## GAME Options


## Introduction

```
This system allows you to resolve a battle in
Five Parsecs without the use of miniatures. It is
useful if you want to progress your campaign,
but can’t set up a tabletop battle due to space
constraints or while traveling.
It can be used at any time and can be mixed
with conventional tabletop battles as you see
fit. Note, however, It is not easily usable with
the Salvage mission type (see p.116).
```
## The Basics of No-minis Combat

```
The battlefield is considered to be an
open, abstract space, filled with terrain for
combatants to lurk behind.
Most of the time, you do not need to track the
positioning of characters using this system.
Each combatant is assumed to be moving
fluidly throughout the battle space. This
applies even if two characters engage in a
Brawl: They are assumed to fight briefly, and
then run for cover. As such, characters are
not assumed to be “near” each other at any
specific point other than when the rules allow
them to engage in Brawling combat.
The battlefield may have specific Locations
present, such as objectives. A character can
move to a Location during the battle using the
rules below.
The turn sequence is heavily modified, as
explained below, but the phases of the no-
minis battle round are:
```
1. **_Battle flow events_**
    _(additional optional rule – see p.71)_
2. **_Initiative_**
3. **_Firefight_**
It is common for some characters to not act
during a given battle round. In such cases,
they are assumed to be moving around
the battle area without encountering a
significant target.

**No-minis**

**combat**

**resolution**

## Designer Notes:

```
This system is designed to provide a heavy
level of abstraction. As such, some weapons,
items and abilities may prove more or less
useful when compared to their normal utility
in battle. Likewise, you may need to provide
interpretation to make a particular item or
situation fit. If in doubt, simply go with the
most reasonable answer.
This system is not easily compatible with
the “AI Variations”, “Escalating Battles” and
“Enemy Deployment Variables” options
elsewhere in this Compendium. House rule
as you see fit.
```
## Game Options


## Initiative Actions

Roll for initiative at the beginning of each
round using **one die less than normal**.

Both your crew captain and any character
assigned a die _equal to or below_ their
Reactions score may attempt one Initiative
Action each. These actions may be done in
any order, and you may carry out one action
before deciding on the next. These are the
moments in which you attempt to improve
your situation in a decisive way, positioning
yourself in the battle space, or otherwise
achieving a particular end.

Characters assigned a die result _higher_ than
their Reactions score are assumed to be
engaged in the general firefight, and do not
take specific actions of their own.

Many actions will require a **Battlefield Test** , in
which you roll **2D6** , attempting to _roll equal
to or above_ the indicated target number. A
failed action has no particular effect other than
failing to carrying it out the task.

## Applicable Bonuses:

```
Characters may have all manner of
abilities, items and features that are
not accounted for in these rules. If a
character has one or more things that
feels like it logically would assist in
performing a specific type of action,
they may claim a single +1 bonus if a
Battlefield Test is required.
Many items, rules and abilities will not
provide a bonus in this combat system.
```
## Enemy Actions:

```
Note that the enemy acts in the firefight
phase and ONLY acts as indicated there.
```
## Game Options


```
ACTION DESCRIPTION 2D6 BATTLEFIELD TEST
Scout for
Locations
```
```
Select a suspected Location that becomes known to the crew.
This action is not possible in the first game round.
```
```
6+ required.
Add +1 for Movement
speed of 5” or above.
Move Up The character moves to any known Location that does
not already have a character present. If a character is at a
Location currently, they may opt to move to the general
battle space instead.
```
```
No roll required.
```
```
Carry Out Task This is typically used for achieving objectives. The character
must be at the correct Location to do so. If the scenario
requires a die roll to be made for an action, the crew
member may carry it out now. The character may still fight
normally if engaged in combat this battle round.
```
```
Dependent on the
scenario.
```
```
Charge Select a random Enemy. After selecting them, you may choose
to engage them in a Brawl which is resolved immediately.
Roll 1D6. If the roll is above your character movement speed,
the enemy may fire upon you at 6” range, counting as Cover.
If you decide not to engage, nothing happens.
```
```
6+ required.
Add +1 for Movement
speed of 5” or above.
Add +1 for use of special
movement device.
```
```
Optimal Shot Select a random Enemy. You may engage them in a Firefight,
as described below. You may select any range up to the
maximum for your weapon. Both characters will fire at the
selected range, with the crew member firing first.
A character unable to fire at the selected range (or at all)
does not fire, and remains available in the Firefight step.
If the Enemy figure fires as part of this combat,
they cannot be selected as an attacker in the Firefight step
later this battle round.
```
```
7+ required.
-1 penalty if using a
Heavy weapon.
```
```
Support Select a crew member. If that crew member is engaged in
combat during this round, the Supporting character may opt
to be engaged instead. Once this action has been taken,
it lasts until the Supporting character is engaged in combat
for any reason. A character could potentially Support multiple
allies at the same time, but all Supports are removed when
they are engaged for any reason.
```
```
No roll required.
```
```
Take Cover The character takes Cover. This affects Firefights as explained
below. The character retains the status until they take a Move
Up action, or has engaged in Brawling combat.
```
```
6+ required.
-1 penalty if at a
Location.
Keep Distance The character can only be selected as a target this round by
enemies with a weapon range exceeding 12”. If selected,
combat is resolved as normal, but both characters can only
use weapons with a range over 12”.
```
```
6+ required.
Add +1 for Movement
speed of 5” or above
```
## Game Options


## Locations

A number of **Locations** may exist on the
battlefield. Any scenario objectives present as
well as any Notable Sights are considered to
be Locations.

All Locations begin battle as **suspected**
Locations. The crew know they are there,
but have not found them yet. They must
be uncovered, usually with the **Scout for
Locations** action (see above).

Characters can move to a **known** Location
using the **Move Up** action. Only one character
may occupy a Location at any given time. Once
at a Location, the character remains there until
they move away using the _Move Up_ action.

Enemies never occupy Locations and cannot
interact with them in any way.

Support
If the targeted character is being Supported,
the Supporting character may opt to take
their place in the engagement. This does not
affect locations.

## The Firefight

```
The main phase of the battle round is the
Firefight. During this phase, the combatants
move around, spot targets, and engage in a
brief exchange of opinion (and gunfire).
Randomly select 3 Enemies (select 4 , if
there are 7 or more total Enemies on the
battlefield). These are the Enemies that
will engage in a Firefight. Any remaining
opponents are assumed to be hiding, trying to
get a Line of Sight, or shooting at shadows.
The Firefight is resolved one Enemy at a
time.
The player may choose the order in which
the Enemies are resolved. When selected to
be resolved, the Enemy will target a random
crew figure and engage them in combat as
explained below. It is possible for more than
one Enemy to target the same crew member.
The specific way an enemy engages is
determined by the weapons they carry:
```
## Game Options


```
When both combatants carry ranged
weapons:
The combatant with the longer weapon range
fires first. If their target survives, the target
then returns fire. If ranges are identical, the
crew figure fires first.
```
_- Each shooter is assumed to be stationary.
- Each shooter uses the maximum range for_
    _their weapon.
- Both combatants are assumed to be in Cover.
- Each shooter will fire their maximum number_
    _of allowed Shots for the weapon in question._
**When there is a Melee-only combatant:**
If one of the two characters involved can attack
only by Brawling, their opponent may shoot
first at **6”** range, counting the target as being
in Cover. The target may not use a _Heavy_ or
_Area_ weapon.
If the target survives, they will then engage in
Brawling combat.

```
If the target fired in defense, they cannot
swap to another weapon and must forego any
Melee weapons bonus. They may receive the
Pistol bonus if they fired a pistol defensively.
If they did not fire in defense, they may use
any weapon to Brawl.
When combatants have both Melee
weapons and guns:
If an Enemy carries a Melee weapon and
is out-ranged by their opponent, they will
engage in Brawling combat instead (as
detailed above). Crew figures may choose to
exercise this option, if desired.
Combatants with Pistol weapons are not
eligible for this rule: It must be a Melee
weapon.
```
Taking Cover

_- If a character is Taking Cover, all shots made_
    _by and against them will hit only on a_
    **_natural 6_**_.
- If an Enemy with any Brawling weapon_
    _engages the character, the two will conduct_
    _Brawling combat, and no fire can be_
    _performed by the character Taking Cover._
    _They may use any weapon carried in the_
    _ensuing Brawl._

```
Further notes:
Multiple attacks: It is possible the same
character would be attacked multiple times.
A character may never fire more than once per
round. When engaged, crew members may
opt not to fire, if desired, while Enemies will
always fire, if able.
Weapon traits: Area and Terrifying are
ignored.
Stun damage: All Stun markers are
removed at the end of the battle round.
Stunned characters cannot attempt to enter
Brawling combat.
```
## Hectic Combat

## (additional optional rule)

```
If you want a more frantic pace of
combat, allow characters to shoot
each time they are engaged by an
enemy. After the initial exchange, any
subsequent attacks by a character
during the same battle round will hit
only on natural 6 s.
```
## Faster Combat

## (additional optional rule)

```
To speed things up, the first exchange
of fire each Firefight phase counts
both combatants as being in the open.
Subsequent exchanges assume cover
as normal.
```
## Game Options


## Battle Flow Events (additional optional rule)

When using the non-miniatures rules, you
may roll on the table below at the beginning
of each battle round. Actions produced by this

```
table do not affect or prevent the characters’
ability to act later in the battle round.
```
```

```
## Game Options


```
Morale
The enemies will take Morale tests as normal
at the end of the round. Morale failures will
remove regular foes first, then Specialists.
```
```
Retreat
At the end of each round, you may attempt
to retreat up to two of your crew. Roll 1D6 for
each figure selected: A roll equal to or below
their movement speed allows them to leave
the battle (as if they had escaped over the
battlefield edge).
Characters with special movement options,
such as when using a Jump Belt, can leave the
battle automatically, and in addition to the two
figures that could be retreated normally.
```
## Mission-specific Notes

```
Access
The console is a suspected Location. Soulless
receive a +1 bonus to locating it.
Acquire
The item is in a suspected Location. It can
then be picked up by a character moving
there. Once the item is in your possession,
the character must exit using the Retreat
rules given above. Should the character
become a casualty, the item becomes a new
known Location.
Defend
No additional notes required.
Deliver
The delivery point is a suspected Location.
If the item is dropped, it becomes a new
known Location.
```
## Game Options


**Eliminate**
The target is not removed due to morale
failures unless it is the last enemy on the
table.

**Fight Off**
No additional notes required.

**Move Through**
The exit is a suspected Location. Once it is
known, a crew member that moves to it can
exit the battlefield, fulfilling the condition.

**Patrol**
Each objective is a suspected Location.
An objective is checked by moving a crew
member there.

**Protect**
The VIP is attached to a crew member and
always accompanies them. While the crew
member is on the field, the VIP cannot

```
be attacked directly. If the crew member
is removed as a casualty, the VIP must act
as a regular character. The objective is a
suspected Location.
Secure
The center of the battlefield is a suspected
Location. Any crew figure that is at the Location
AND is not attacked in Brawling combat for 2
consecutive rounds will achieve the objective.
Search
Assume there are 5 suspected Locations
capable of holding the item.

bones, as it was intended as a springboard
for narrative or user-created scenarios.
However, players who prefer a more rules-led
experience can use this expanded method to
add detail to their Quest scenarios.
This system should be used for every step of a
given Quest, but you may opt to use it for one
Quest and then not for another as you see fit.
```
What does not Change?

_- Quests are still acquired as per the_
    _normal rules.
- The first battle in a Quest is fought as a_
    _normal mission._

```
Quest Progression
In Post-Battle Sequence Step 3. “Determine
Quest Progress”, the system below is used in
place of the core rulebook system.
Roll 1D6 , adding the number of Quest
Rumors you have acquired so far.
On a modified score of 6 or lower , roll on the
Quest Progression table below to determine
your next step.
On a modified score of 7 or higher , you have
reached the Quest Conclusion. Go to the
Quest Conclusion section (p.80)
```

**D100
ROLL QUEST PROGRESSION**

```
01-10 You track down a source of possible information, but it may not be cheap.
It costs 1D6 Credits. Until this has been paid, you cannot progress the Quest.
Once it is paid, receive 1 Quest Rumor.
11-20 You need time to analyze the data you have found. You generate research points equal to
the combined Savvy scores of your crew members, +1D6.
If the total research points equals or exceeds 20 , you have solved this step and
receive 1 Quest Rumor.
If not, you may continue accumulating research points every campaign turn until you
reach the total. Until this has been done, you cannot progress the Quest.
21-28 You’ve figured out where to go, but you are not liking it one bit!
Randomly determine an enemy as normal, but add +2 to the number encountered ,
and reduce their Panic range by -1. You may take on this battle at any time, but until you do,
you cannot progress the Quest.
If you Hold the Field, receive 1 Quest Rumor.
29-38 To progress is going to require a lot of hard work. A special Work on the Quest crew task
becomes available. This has no effect other than to help complete this step. Once a total of
6 such tasks have been performed by your crew, receive 1 Quest Rumor. You can perform the
actions over multiple campaign turns, but cannot progress the Quest until this is completed.
39-53 You need to find a data cache with information. Set up a normal Opportunity mission with
the Access mission objective. The enemy is deployed within 3” of the objective with your crew
setting up at least 12” from any enemy figures. When the mission is completed,
receive 1 Quest Rumor.
Until the mission is completed, you cannot progress the Quest.
54-65 You’ve located a data cache, but it’s in a very bad place. Set up a mission with no objectives.
Your crew sets up in the middle of the table. Randomly determine a foe from the
Roving Threats table (core rules, p.101). No enemies begin on the table,
but every round, during the Enemy Action phase, one basic enemy arrives from the
center of each of the four battlefield edges.
At the end of each round, roll 1D6 and track the scores. If you have an Engineer among
your crew, add +1 to the score. Once the score reaches 28 , you can end the mission.
Claim 1 Quest Rumor. You cannot progress the Quest until you complete this step.
66-80 A business contact might be able to help, but first:
Set up a Protect mission. The enemy AI is changed to Aggressive.
When the mission is completed, receive 1 Quest Rumor. Until the mission is completed,
you cannot progress the Quest.
81-92 The enemy is massing. All future battles that are part of the Quest must add +1 to the number
of enemies encountered (entry 54-65 above is unaffected). Add 1 Quest Rumor.
93-100 The enemy is becoming more determined. All future battles that are part of the Quest reduce
the enemy Panic range by -1. Add 1 Quest Rumor.
```
## Game Options


```
Quest Conclusion
Once you have unlocked the conclusion, you
can go to it at any time.
This final battle is always a Straight Up Fight
with no special conditions.
You must add +1 to the number of enemies
encountered (plus any modifications from
the Quest Progression table above), and the
```
```
enemy is always accompanied by a Unique
Individual. They will not test Morale during
this battle – every opponent is here to fight to
the death. Completing the Quest awards you:
```
_- When rolling for Credits,_ **_roll twice_** _, pick the_
    **_highest_** _score, and add_ **_+1_**_.
- You may roll_ **_three times_** _on the_ **_Loot_** _table.
- You may add_ **_+1 Story Point_**_._

**Expanded Connections**

```
This expands the Connections rule on p.164
of the core rulebook, adding more features
and variations, allowing for more detailed and
elaborate stories to unfold in your campaign.
Unlike the shorter system in the Appendix, the
process presented here doesn’t require you to
create your own scenarios.
```
```
What is a Connection?
A Connection is a link between the current
mission or battle and a narrative element,
typically a character or prior event which may
have happened in your campaign, or which
```
```
is revealed as part of the Connection. You will
then play out a new event or side mission,
building on that narrative.
```
```
Checking for Connections
Check for Connections any time you determine
that you will be playing an Opportunity
mission. While establishing the objectives
and parameters, roll 1D6 with a 5 or 6
indicating that the mission has a Connection.
Connections do not occur during Quest, Rival
or Patron missions.
```
## Game Options


If you are playing your first game since
purchasing this expansion, have a Connection
happen automatically this campaign turn.

Expanded Connections table
Make a **D6** roll and use the Expanded
Connections table below (and resulting
subtables) to determine the nature of the
Connection:

```
D6 CONNECTION IS
1-2 A person you’ve met
(see Connections subtable 1 )
3 A place you’ve been
(see Connections subtable 2 )
4 A job you’ve done
(see Connections subtable 3 )
5 A faction or group you have met before
(see Connections subtable 4 )
6 A personal Connection for a random crew
member (see Connections subtable 5 )
```
Some events may allow you to turn the job
down. If so, fight a random Opportunity
mission without generating a Connection for
it. These events are marked with an * on the
subtables below.

Seize any opportunity immediately next
campaign turn, or the option disappears.

```
Notes:
When a result says to play a particular mission,
it refers to mission objectives in the core
rulebook. It may refer you to a specific mission
table (such as the Patron Mission Objectives
table). This can be replaced with the expanded
table in this book, if desired.
When a result instructs you to fight a Roving
Threat, Criminal Element, Hired Muscle, or
Interested Party, it is referring to a random
encounter rolled for from that encounter table
in the core rulebook.
```
## No-roll option

```
If you prefer to reduce dice-rolling, a
Connection occurs any time you play
an Opportunity mission AND the prior
Opportunity mission did not have a
Connection (in other words, every other time).
```
## Designer note

```
If you prefer to maintain variety, swap
a result you have already had this
campaign for the first new result in the
same subtable.
```
## Game Options


```
Subtable 1
```
```
D6 NOTES
1* An old friend is in trouble and needs to be saved. The enemy is generated from the
Criminal Elements table (core rules, p.94). You will play out the Assault objective
(from the Rival Attacks table, core rules, pp.91-92). If you fail or decline the mission,
your friend gets killed, causing the loss of 1 Story Point. If you succeed, the enemy automatically
becomes a Rival but you may roll up a new character (using all character creation tables as
normal), as your friend decides to join you.
2 An associate gave you the location of a suspected data cache. Play an unlicensed salvage job.
If you investigate all Points of Interest, add 2 Quest Rumors.
3* Someone you’ve worked for in the past has reached out to collect on a favor owed. The job will
use the Patron Mission Objectives table, and any objective must be achieved in 6 rounds.
The enemy will be accompanied by 1 additional Specialist. If you achieve the job successfully,
your contact pays you 2 additional Credits. You may choose to turn the job down.
4 You got a cryptic message from a friend who has gotten in over their head. Set up the scenario
(with a Fight Off objective) against an enemy from the Criminal Elements table (core rules, p.94).
After setting up, randomly select a standard enemy that is actually your friend. They will move
as per normal AI but will not attack the crew. If any crew member moves within 4” of them, they
immediately switch sides and fight alongside you for the rest of the battle (counting as having a
Reactions score of 1 ). If they survive the battle, or you manage to move them off the table-edge,
claim +1 Story Point , and you can keep any weapons they carried.
5* A old associate of yours wants payback on their former organization. If you accept the job, set up
an Eliminate objective against an enemy from the Hired Muscle enemy table (core rules, p.96).
The enemy will have 2 additional basic troopers on the table. If you complete the mission, you
receive one additional Loot roll. If the mission takes more than 5 rounds , you must add the
enemy as a Rival as they have time to identify you.
6* You received an “anonymous” tip that could only have come from one person. This usually means
trouble. If you agree to take the job on, play a Search objective. You will face 2 fewer enemies
than normal, but at the end of Round 4 , 1D6 additional enemies arrive from the center of a
randomly selected table edge. If 5 or 6 enemies arrive, 1 of them will be a specialist. The rest will
be basic enemies. If you achieve the objective, you receive one additional Loot roll.
```
## Game Options


**_Subtable 2_**

The prior location can be any place you can
think of; for example, it may have been a place
your captain visited before the campaign
began. However, it will be most fun

```
if it is a place you fought a battle during the
current campaign, in which case set up the
table to resemble the original layout as much
as possible.
```
```
D6 NOTES
1* Your research suggests that the location was hiding something of interest. If you choose to go back,
play out a Search mission against an enemy from the Hired Muscle table (core rules, p.96).
The enemy is automatically accompanied by a Unique Individual. If you find the objective,
gain 3 Quest Rumors immediately.
2* A prior mission site has been overrun by critters, and you are worried the situation will escalate.
Roll on the Roving Threat table (core rules, p.101) to determine what is crawling around.
If you choose to go back, play a Defend mission and add +1 to the number encountered.
If the mission fails or you decline, and it was an Invasion Threat, the world you are presently on
is invaded automatically (even if you are no longer on the same world, they were using it as a
staging ground for sector-wide attacks).
If the mission fails or you decline and the enemy was not an Invasion Threat, all future Invasion
rolls on this world are subject to a +1 modifier.
3* Bad guys have set up in the ruins of the battle, and you could earn a few pennies turning
them in. If you take the offer, play an Eliminate mission against an enemy chosen from the
Criminal Elements list (core rules, p.94). You receive +2 Credits for completing the job.
4* One of your crew (randomly select them, but they cannot be the captain)
confides that they have a secret reason to go back. If you indulge them, play an Acquire objective.
If the crew member in question is the one to carry the item off the battlefield,
they earn 3 XP and you receive 1 Story Point.
Note that if the crew member in question is a Swift, they (and any other Swift crew) will go back
without you if you do not agree to help. In this case, play out a separate mission using only those
characters. They will receive no Credits for the mission but receive +2 XP each.
5 Just happens to be the same place... surely it’s just a coincidence, right? Fight a Rival battle using
the Ambush mission. Pick a random past Rival that has come back to take one more shot at you
(literally!). If you have no past Rivals, pick a current one or roll a random opponent (an enemy you
made before the campaign started). The enemy brought 2 additional Specialists to this fight,
and their Panic range is reduced by 1 (so 1-3 becomes 1-2, 1-2 becomes a 1, and a 1 remains
unchanged). If you walk out of here the winner, your captain earns +3 XP.
6* The site is abandoned, but you suspect there may be some interesting bits to scavenge by now.
Play an unlicensed salvage job , against a Roving Threat (see core rules, p.101).
You may choose not to take the job.
```

Subtable 3
The prior job can be any previous job you did
during this campaign. Pick one that captures

tough to win. Alternatively, select the mission
you played 3 campaign turns ago.
```
```
D6 NOTES
1 Some random grunt has decided to make revenge their primary goal.
The enemy type you fought during the job becomes a Rival and immediately attacks you.
The enemy is accompanied by an Enemy Boss from the Unique Individual table
(core rules, p.105) in addition to all normal numbers. If you kill the Boss, remove the
Rival automatically, otherwise they will follow the normal rules for Rivals.
2* Your employer kept your info in their cyber-dex. Generate an objective from the Patron Mission
Objectives table (core rules, p.89). You may roll on the Patron job Danger Pay and Benefits
tables (core rules, p.83), to see what they offer. The enemy will have 1 additional Specialist.
If you turn the job down after generating the details, no harm is done.
3 Whoever you fought against had a powerful sponsor that has you in their sights. Set up a random
mission as normal. The enemy adds a Freelancer Unique Individual that is removed from the
table after Round 5. If you kill the Freelancer, claim 2 Quest Rumors.
4* You picked up some encrypted intel during the job, and have finally been able to decipher it.
Discard all Quest Rumors and begin a Quest immediately. For the duration of the Quest,
roll 1D6 during every mission: On a 6 , the enemy is accompanied by a Secret Agent.
If you want to stay safe, you can sell the intel instead, earning 3 Credits.
5* You receive a strange message referencing the job, and imploring you to meet up.
If you decide to go, play a Protect mission, but the VIP is a Corporate Slick (core rules, p.172).
If they survive, and you complete the mission, your next campaign turn will be an
Opportunity mission with a randomly generated Connection.
If you complete your objective in the next mission, add +1 Story Point.
6* The contact that gave you that job has dug up some dirt on their employer. If you want to take
the offer, play out an Acquire mission against a Hired Muscle enemy (core rules, p.96). The
enemies are particularly well-trained guards, and r educe their Panic range by 1. If they would be
Toughness 3 , raise it to 4. If you complete the mission in 5 rounds or less , earn 1D6 Credits.
```
## Game Options


**_Subtable 4_**

```
D6 NOTES
1* A random Rival has offered a ceasefire if you give them a hand with something. If you agree, fight
a random Opportunity mission, and victory allows you to remove the old Rival from your roster.
The enemy force reduces their Panic range by 1 , and will include 1 additional basic enemy. You
will be accompanied by one basic figure from your Rivals force, with a Reaction score of 2 for the
purpose of the mission, and will fight alongside you. They leave after the mission is over, however.
2* An employee wishes to defect from a Patron you have worked for in the past.
Play an Acquire mission, but instead of a package, the “item” is a Scientist (core rules, p.172).
They are placed on the table when you “pick up” the package, and act as part of your crew for
the rest of the mission. If you rescue them, the Patron refuses to ever work with you again,
but your grateful new contact gives you a Loot roll as they managed to grab a package on the
way out. You may also add 1 Story Point. You can opt to turn down the job.
3* A former Patron has need of you. Pick a prior Patron, who offers you a job immediately.
All details are rolled up normally.
4 You are not sure if you are being set up. You will fight against the same enemy you fought last
mission (if it was a Roving Threat, fight in the same location, but against a randomly determined
enemy from the Hired Muscle table instead – core rules, p.96), but they are automatically
accompanied by a Secret Agent Unique Individual (core rules, p.97), and all Panic ranges are
reduced by 1 (meaning a 1-3 is counted as 1-2, 1-2 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).
5 A former employer gives you a tip to something interesting that one of their agents discovered.
Roll twice for Notable Sights in the mission (core rules, p.89), but at the end of Round 4,
any sight that has not been acquired is removed from the table.
6 You’ve come across information that would be valuable to a random former Patron.
If you win the mission, you can claim the data. If you hand it over, they become a Persistent
Patron. If you opt to sell the data on the black market, add 2 Credits.
```

```
Subtable 5
Randomly select which crew member is
involved. This cannot be the captain of
the crew.
```
```
You can turn the job down, but if you achieve
your objective, the crew member in question
gains +2 XP , and you gain +1 Story Point.
```
```
D6 NOTES
1* Your crew has some old enemies making their lives miserable, and would appreciate some help.
Fight an Eliminate mission against a Criminal Element (core rules, p.94). A random basic enemy
(non-specialist, non-leader) adds +1 to each of Toughness and Combat Skill.
2* Your crew has friends/allies/relatives that could use a hand keeping their colony/farmstead/facility
safety. Play a Patrol mission against a Roving Threat (core rules, p.101).
There is no chance of Invasion due to this encounter.
3* Something was stolen from their family/allies/unit, and they have finally tracked down the location.
Play an Access mission against Criminal Elements (core rules, p.94). The enemy is accompanied
by an Enemy Boss Unique Individual (core rules, p.105).
4* They need to make contact with someone important to them. Play a Move Through mission against
a Roving Threat (core rules, p.101). Add one basic enemy to the number encountered.
5* Well, someone upset the wrong people! You can either hand over your crew member (remove
them from your roster), or slug it out. If you fight, generate a Hired Muscle enemy (core rules, p.96)
and add 2 specialists AND 2 basic enemies to the number encountered.
You will play out a Raid mission from the Rival Attacks table (core rules, pp.91-92).
6* Your crew member found a lead on something promising. Play out a Secure objective.
If you succeed, add 1 Quest Rumor.

## Game Options


This section modifies combat to be more
dramatic, particularly resulting in more
movement during a firefight. It also addresses
a slight imbalance between the rules for
ranged and melee-only combatants.

It is intended to be used with the **Dramatic
Weapons** table in this book (see pp.88-89),
but can be used on its own as well.

Adjusted Shooting
Change the shooting table to be as follows:

```
Target is in the open 5+
Target is in cover 6+
```
Duck Back
Being shot at can be disconcerting, and it
takes nerves of steel to calmly return fire.

At the end of each phase, any figure that was
shot at will test for **_Duck Back_** if they meet **all
three** of the conditions listed:

_-_ **_At least one firer_** _was_ **_more than 6” away_**_.
- They were_ **_NOT hit by any shots_**_.
- They are_ **_not a robot_**

Make a single **D6** test, regardless of the
number of shots aimed at the character:

Characters in the open will _Duck Back_ on a **3+**

Characters in or directly behind Cover will
_Duck Back_ on a **4+**

A character _Ducking Back_ will immediately
try to **move to the closest location that
improves their level of protection** (moving
from the open to Cover, or from Cover to out-

```
of-sight) against at least one figure that fired
upon them.
If the character is unable to improve their
position in this move, they will instead move
to the most distant position they can reach
that offers the same level of protection
against each attacker.
Ducking back is a bonus action and does
not affect the ability of the character to act
normally during their activation.
Figures only check for Duck Back once after
each phase, though an enemy being shot at
(and being missed) in both the Quick and
Slow Action phases could potentially Duck
Back twice.
```
```
Lunge Attack
When a ravenous Krorg is bearing down on
you, you’d better not miss.
A Lunge attack may be carried out if all of the
following apply:
```
_- A ranged attack is done against a target_
    _within_ **_6”_** _AND_ **_all Shots miss_**_.
- The target character has_ **_no ranged weapon_**
    _OR has_ **_at least one weapon with the_**
    **_Melee trait_**_.
- The target character_ **_does not carry any_**
    **_weapon with the Heavy trait_**_._
If an enemy has no ranged weapons or their
effective Combat Skill (including Melee
weapon bonus) exceeds that of the firer, they
will carry out the _Lunge_. Player characters may
choose to do so if desired.

**DRAMATIC**

**COMBAT**

## Game Options


```
A Lunging character is immediately moved a
full move towards the shooter, attempting to
enter Brawling combat. Lunging characters
may ignore up to 2” of movement reduction
(due to obstacles or similar).
```
```
A given character can only Lunge once per
round. Lunging is a bonus action and does
not affect the ability of the character to act
normally during their activation.
```
**Dramatic Weapons**

```
This updated weapons table tweaks the
weapon selection for a couple of reasons: First,
it fine-tunes a few weapons that were a little
too strong or which could use a boost. More
importantly, it also makes the weapons feel a
bit more distinctive on the battlefield.
If using this weapons table, you should also
use the “Adjusted Shooting” hit numbers
from the Dramatic Combat section of this
chapter (p.87).

While many weapons have seen minor
tweaks, of particular note are pistols,
which should feel more like proper close-
quarters weapons, and melee weapons,
which have received small boosts across
the board. Area weapons no longer have
inherent Shots on their profile, instead
dealing damage only through the Area
rule, which should make them faster to
use in play.

Area Select a target point within range. Every figure within 2” of the target point are hit on an
unmodified D6 roll of 4+ ( 5+ if partially obscured from the blast).
Burn Non-robot targets that are hit but survive will move a full move in a random direction.
This does not apply to hits deflected by armor.
Clumsy -1 to Brawling rolls if opponent has higher Speed.

Stun Any target hit is Stunned , even if the attack was deflected by Armor.
```
## Game Options


```
Grid-based movement allows more freeform
movement by dividing the battlefield into
several Grid spaces, simplifying movement and
positioning in combat while maintaining the
normal movement system for close-quarters
fighting. It offers a faster and more free-flowing
experience in the opening stages of a battle.
This method is particularly suitable if you have
set up the battlefield as the blocks of a town
and city, but is practical for most terrain types.
Players should note that while this option
is comparable to normal game play, some
differences are inevitable: As such, a given
character, weapon or ability may be slightly
stronger or weaker than when using the
normal movement system.
You do not have to commit to using this system
for every battle of a given campaign. The
movement system used can be changed as
often as you want, with different battles using
different movement systems if desired.
```
## The Battle Space

```
The play area is divided into a grid with 3 or 4
squares along each side (for a total of 9, 12 or
16 sectors depending on whether your grid
is 3x3, 3x4, or 4x4). Typically, you want the
squares to be 8-9” across.
The grid spaces should be roughly square. You
may mark them with small beads, markers,
or pieces of scatter terrain, or just eyeball the
rough positions. The size of each square will
depend on the number you have chosen for
your grid and the size of your gaming table.
```
```
When placing terrain, objectives, and other
things on the table, it is common to set up
terrain within the grid, but there is no specific
need to do so. Terrain can be placed in any
manner that looks natural and interesting, and
can cross boundaries.
```
```
PLAYER’S TABLE EDGE
```
```
Above: 3x3" table, 4x4 grid = 9" square
```
## Initial Deployment

```
When deploying the two sides for an
encounter, all figures must set up in a square
that touches their assigned table edge.
You cannot set up a figure more than halfway
into a grid square. For example, if a sector is
8” across, figures must begin within 4” of the
table edge (it is fine to eyeball this rather than
measure exactly). Otherwise, figures can be
set up freely, and you are not required to place
every figure in the same square.
```
```
FIGURE SET-UP
```
# GRID-BASED

# MOVEMENT

## GAME OPTions


## Figure Status

When a figure is selected to act, the square it
is currently within is determined to be either
**Open** or at **Close Quarters**.

A Close Quarters square has enemy figures
within it (regardless of the range between
opposing figures), while an Open square only
has figures belonging to one side. If a scenario
involves neutral third parties, their presence
does not affect this status while neutral.

Note: The status is determined at the
moment of activation, and can change
during a battle round. For example, if Figure
1 activates, fires, and removes the only
enemy in a square as a casualty, the square
is Open for Figure 2’s activation.

## Multi-squares

A **Multi-square** exists when the terrain
within the grid space on the table contains
more than one square. This happens in two
circumstances, both of which could be present
in the same square:

_- When a square contains a structure_
    _with an interior space that can be used_
    _in the game (such as removable roofs_
    _on buildings or transferring miniatures_
    _to floor plans). The interior space is_
    _considered its own sub-square.
- When a square contains buildings or other_
    _terrain that has multiple, usable levels of_
    _height (such as a building with a flat roof_
    _that figures can access and fight from)._
    _Each height level is considered its own_
    _sub-square._

When using multi-squares, entry points must
be designated that allow travel between the
sub-squares. This is usually a ladder, doorway,
elevator, or similar.

For a complex multi-square, you could even
have sub-squares that are only reachable
from a specific sub-square. You could even

```
have a sub-square that connects to two
different main squares. (Note that this can get
out of hand quickly!)
Example:
One of my sectors which I identify as Sector 3 )
has an interior building which I will set up
using a separate floor plan ( Sector 3b ),
a rooftop landing pad ( Sector 3c ), and a flat
roof overlooking the landing pad ( Sector 3d ).
The interior is reachable from the exterior door.
A ladder connects 3b and 3c , and a flight of
stairs connects 3c and 3d.
This is a rather ambitious setup for a typical
Five Parsecs battle, and is probably better
suited to a custom scenario with lots of troops!
During play, each sub-square is considered
independent and is considered its own square
for all game purposes except where directly
stated otherwise.
Note: If this rule option sounds too abstract
for you, put it to one side at first. Multi-squares
are well suited for longer custom scenarios
where you might have to fight your way inside
a research facility or similar.
```
## Flanking

```
If setting up enemies using the Half Flank or
Bolstered Flank deployment variables from
page 45 of this book, the flanking force is set
up in the second square counting from the
enemy table edge. If a scenario requires any
figure to arrive from the flank, they are placed
in a similar fashion.
```
## GAME Options


## GRID-BASED MOVEMENT

```
If the square is Open, the figure may move in
one of the following fashions:
```
_-_ **_Move to an adjacent square or_**
    **_accessible sub-square_**
    _If the square is in one of the four_
    _“keyboard” directions (up, down, left,_
    _right) the figure is assumed to be moving_
    _normally and may still act. If the square_
    _is diagonal, the figure is assumed to_
    _have_ Dashed_.
-_ **_Move within the square_**
    _The figure can move to any location within_
    _the current square. It is assumed to move_
    _normally and may still act._

```
Deploying
When a figure enters another square
with Open movement, they are said to be
Deploying.
The figure may Deploy anywhere within their
base move of the edge of the square they came
from (corner for diagonal moves, entry point
for sub-squares). Figures may Deploy directly
into a Brawl.
For example, a figure with Speed: 4 could
deploy anywhere within 4” of the point they
enter from.
```
## Close Quarters Movement

```
If the square is at Close Quarters, movement
is conducted using the core rules regardless of
whether a border is crossed.
A figure that moves from a Closed to an Open
square conducts their entire activation based
on the Closed square movement rules.
```
## GAME OPTions


## Proximity Questions

All questions of whether a figure is within
a certain distance from another figure,
objectives, etc., are handled using core
rules methods. Such proximity may extend
across squares and is not affected by the
status of a square.

**_Example:_** _If a game rule requires being
within_ **_6”_** _of something, a figure_ **_5”_** _away in an
adjacent sector still counts._

## Ranged Combat

Ranged combat is conducted using the core
rules, including range, Line of Sight, and so on.

This means positioning within the square is
important.

## Brawling

```
Brawling combat is initiated when a figure
moves into contact with an opponent,
regardless of the method of movement.
This typically happens during Close
Quarters movement.
```
## Unusual Movement

```
Any unusual movement methods such
as Jump or Teleport functions as normal
movement using the core rules.
Items and abilities that adjust standard
movement speeds apply to Deployment
ranges and Close Quarters movement, but
do not otherwise affect grid movement.
```
## GAME Options


**Using Terrain Generators**

```
The following terrain generators are supplied
for people who prefer a randomly generated
table setup. This can be used to provide an
additional challenge, as inspiration for terrain
building projects or for players who prefer
to have less direct control over aspects of the
scenario. You could even generate several
tables in advance and sketch them out on
index cards, giving you a library of ready-to-use
terrain setups for when you want to game but
wish to focus your creativity elsewhere.
Exact sizes for terrain pieces will depend on
your gaming table and collection. A 2x2-foot
table will need smaller pieces than a 3x3-
foot table, for example. If your final table
feels a little too sparse, there’s a good chance
your terrain pieces are too small; you can
```
```
compensate for this by adding more “scatter”
(small single pieces like rocks, barrels, or
individual trees).
To use the generator, work through the
following steps in turn:
```
```
Step 1: Quarters and Sectors
Divide the table into four quarters, and then
subdivide each quarter into four sectors of
roughly equal size (for a total of 16 sectors).
If you wish, mark the sectors in any suitable
manner, but eyeballing it is fine as well. This
does not have to be precise and, if some
sectors or quarters are a little bigger or
small, it won’t matter that much.
You should also find the approximate
center of the table and place a die or small
marker there.
```
# Terrain

# Generation

## Customizing the Terrain Tables

```
You can easily customize these tables in a
number of ways:
```
_- You can swap out entries for options that_
    _you like better or which fit your terrain_
    _collection better.
- You can create a new terrain table by_
    _modifying the entries in an existing table to_
    _fit a new style (such as a jungle or ice world).
- You might “cycle” through terrain to keep_
    _things fresh, changing an entry after_
    _each game._

## Gaming Mats

```
If you have a terrain mat, you can still
use this system. Count the terrain that
is already marked on the map, reduce
the number of terrain dice, and then
add additional pieces in the open
spaces. The combination of 2D and
3D terrain might take a moment to
get used to, but it can give you a lot of
flexibility. If such a mix bothers you,
make sure to purchase a mat without
pre-printed terrain.
```
## GAME OPTions


Step 2: The Center
The center of the table always contains a
notable terrain feature. Roll **D6** on the relevant
**Notable Feature** table and place this feature
so that it partially covers the center of the table.
The notable feature does not have to be placed
precisely over the center, and can be aligned
in any direction you like as long as part of the
feature covers the center point.

**_Example:_**
_Using the Industrial tables, I roll a_ **_5_** _, indicating
a_ **_cargo area_**_. I have a collection of shipping
containers that I arrange in a rough square, with
the corner covering the center of the table._

Step 3: The Quarters
Work through the quarters one at a time in any
order you like. For each quarter, roll four D6s
and consult the Regular Features table for your
chosen terrain type to determine what features
will be present.

You can assign the features to the sectors as
you see fit, but each sector must have at least
part of a terrain feature located within it. It is
okay for a terrain feature to overlap two sectors.
The size of features can be selected based on
what you have available, but should not be
longer and wider than the size of one sector,
and most can be smaller than that.

**_Example:_**
_Continuing with my Industrial table, I roll_ **_1_** _,_ **_2_** _,_
**_4_** _, and_ **_5_** _for the first quarter. I pick out a_ **_length
of wall_** _, a_ **_colony building_** _, some_ **_fuel barrels_** _,
and a_ **_random robot_** _I have sitting around. I
put the building in the center of the quarter
with the wall extending off one corner. The fuel
barrels get strewn around the “front yard” of the
building, with the robot being placed a small
distance away from the building to look like it’s
a machine they use regularly._

```
Step 4: Add Scatter Terrain
After you finish each quarter, add D6 pieces
of scatter terrain : Scatter terrain can be a fuel
barrel, crate, rock, piece of rubble, single tree
or similar, and should be about big enough
that a single human figure can take cover
behind them.
Place this scatter terrain anywhere within the
quarter to add a few items to hide behind while
crossing open ground, or simply to make an
area more visually appealing.
```
```
Step 5: Final Evaluation
Once you have placed everything on the table,
take a moment to step back and evaluate
things: You may realize that the table would
look better if a couple of pieces were swapped
or moved around. You might also realize that
one particular piece doesn’t look like it fits
and should be replaced with something more
appropriate. For example, you might realize
that some trees ended up next to an industrial
feature, and swap them out for a pile of crates
and oil drums instead.
Make any tweaks and changes at this point to
get a really fun table. You do not have to stick to
the sector and quarter rules at this stage.
If things feel cluttered, you are usually going to
be just fine: The game improves by having a lot
of terrain to crawl between.
You might also add some cosmetic touches
at this stage, such as some sand to mark a
road, a few tumbleweeds, bits of shrubbery, or
whatever else you have in mind. If in doubt,
consider scattering a few clumps of modeling
flock, or some small pebbles. These factors are
mostly for show but do make the game more
immersive to look at.
```
## GAME Options


**Terrain Tables**

```
Four types of terrain table are provided:
```
_-_ **_Industrial_** _(covering the typical semi-urban_
    _semi-factory look that’s popular for Five_
    _Parsecs tables)
-_ **_Wilderness_** _(natural features with lots of_
    _foliage). This option can also be employed_
    _for waste ground areas within otherwise_
    _urban settings.
-_ **_Alien Ruin_** _(exploring old, strange sites)._
    _This option may also be applied to undercity_
    _areas where one settlement has been built_
    _on the foundations of an earlier, alien_
    _civilization.
-_ **_Crash Site_** _(a location where a shuttle or_
    _craft wrecked)._

```
These tables can also be easily modified to
create your own custom terrain generators,
whether to fit your own collection better or
creating brand new environments to play in.
```
```
Industrial Site
Industrial battle areas are a great way to get
some use out of random construction vehicle
models or robot kits you have sitting around.
They can often be used as is, or you might
modify them to fit your intended visual theme.
Model buildings can be found in a variety
of materials, but creating your own from
polystyrene foam or card board is easy and fun.
Be aware that spray paints, and cyanoachrylate
adhesives such as Super Glue can melt
polystyrene foam (according to your wishes or
otherwise!) – if doing so, make sure you are
working in a well-ventilated area.

6
```
```
Industrial or urban terrain such as
shipping containers, a cluster of barrels, or
a large civilian vehicle.
```
```
Wilderness
Whether you are building it yourself or buying
ready-made pieces, earth-style trees and
bushes are easy to find guides and material
for. Alien plant life can do wonders in making
a world seem suitably science fiction. Plastic
plants for fish tanks are a great source for
strange looking plants, often in bright colors
and quite cheap. Fish tank decorations also
include oddly shaped rock formations, which
again look great on a sci-fi gaming table.
You can also experiment with adding paint
to “Earth-like” plant models to change
their colors.
```
```
D6 NOTABLE FEATURES

## GAME Options


```
Alien Ruin
Digging through the rubble of long-gone
civilizations is classic adventure stuff, and a
good excuse for some odd terrain features.
These can also be adapted to be the ruins
of an abandoned colony if you prefer. While
it may be a big demand on your terrain
collection, this type of table will look better
if the structures have a style distinctive from
your normal game features.
```
```
D6 NOTABLE FEATURES
1 Scatter terrain with plants mixed in
2 Large pile of rubble and debris
3 Large, ruined building, possibly multi-story
```
```
4
Remnants of a landing pad or town plaza,
but overgrown with plants
5 Ruined tower surrounded by rubble
```
```
6
Large statue surrounded by
plants or rubble
```
```
D6 REGULAR FEATURES
```
```
1
Odd feature such as crystals, weird plants,

2 Ruined single building
```
```
3
Partial ruin (such as half of a building
surrounded by rubble)
4 Open space with a few items of scatter
5 Strange statue or vehicle wreck
6 Scattered plants with some rubble
```
```
Crash Site
Freelancers like to snoop around crash sites,
whether to rescue and aid survivors or to loot
the wreckage. If a large craft goes down, it is
likely to have scattered debris for miles. As
such, you don’t need to build a giant spaceship
model to use this terrain type. If you do have a
crashed ship model, you can skip the Notable
Features roll and stick the wreck in the center
of the table.
```
```
D6 NOTABLE FEATURES

```
1
Structure with damage (or reduced to a
heap of rubble)
```
```
2
Cluster of natural features (rocks, plants)

Open with scatter. Mixture of natural
features and wreckage.
2 Scattered bits of wreckage
3 Larger piece of wreckage
4 Crater
5 Natural feature (rocks, plants, hedgerow)
6 Open ground, with smoke from fire

## GAME OPTions


**CasualtY TABLES**

Typically combat is a quick and brutal affair: If
you hit and the damage roll equals or exceeds
Toughness, the figure is removed unless they
can succeed in a saving throw (which many
figures lack and the ones that do have one
rarely have a high chance of success).

If you want combat to be a bit longer and
less predictable, you can use the casualty
tables in this chapter to shake things up. They
introduce a random outcome when a figure
would become a casualty, and tend to keep
combatants in the fight longer than normal.

How to Use
Whenever a figure would become a casualty
due to an event or attack that inflicts damage
through the standard mechanics, roll **D6** roll
on the appropriate table below. Use the most
suitable category for the type of creature. The
**Regular** column is used for your crew figures
and normal enemies (including specialists).
The **Boss** column is used for your crew captain,
any enemy leader and unique personalities.

If an attack inflicts multiple hits on a character,
make all the Toughness rolls first, then roll on
the Casualty table once for each attack that
equals or exceeds Toughness. ONLY the single
highest result from the casualty rolls is applied.

**_Example:_** _My crew member lights up a
Converted trooper with a rattle gun and inflicts
two hits that beat Toughness. I roll a_ **_2_** _and a_ **_5_**
_on the casualty table meaning the_ **_5_** _is applied.
The Converted is removed from play._

```
“Okay, so they fell into a lava pit in deep space
while a Tamurian Skull Exploder erupted inside
them. And then the black hole swallowed the
remains while...”
If a game event results in a character
automatically becoming a casualty without a
Toughness roll, the casualty tables are not used.
The character is removed from play normally.
```
```
Narrative Styles
While the default is that the tables are applied
to both friendly and enemy figures, you don’t
have to do it that way. For a more heroic game,
apply the rules to your crew but not the enemy.
This can also work well if you like to play with a
smaller crew than normal or if you like to add
a few extra bad guys for an epic firefight. If you
find this approach to casualties makes things a
little on the easy side, apply a few other options
to tweak things.
For a narrower application, use these rules only
for Boss-type characters.

```
If the Hit roll was a natural 6 , roll one

the highest result as normal.
Perceptive players will note that when
shooting at targets in cover, inexperienced
shooters often only hit on a 6 and thus always
score a Critical Hit. This is fine: After all, if you
are peeking out from behind cover you are
exposing your head and chest, which would
be critical locations if struck.

**DETAILED POST-BATTLE INJURIES**

Some players seem to get excited when
a game offers gruesome ways for their
characters to be maimed, mangled, and
dismembered. The injury table on the
following page can be used in place of the one
in the core rules, and allows more detailed
outcomes for getting hurt.

Synthetic characters are less squishy and
tend to have interchangeable parts, so they
continue using the core rules Bot Injury table
(core rules, p.122)

Some injuries will now require medical
treatment to recover completely. This can be
paid for when conducting your normal healing/
Sick Bay recovery.

```
To determine if a particular planet has the
required facilities roll 1D6 :
```
```

```
A crew member must take a
campaign action and roll 6+ on a

## Scenarios & Settings

```
If you or a friend are learning the core rules
of the game before advancing to the optional
rules in the rest of this expansion, this
introductory campaign will guide you through
each step of the core rules. This campaign
will allow you to focus on learning a few new
concepts at a time, integrating each aspect
of the rules before moving on to the next
one. Before starting, print out the reference
and record sheets from the back of the core
rulebook. The reference sheets will help you
during games, while the record sheets are
used to keep your adventures organized. Don’t
worry if they look confusing at first, you’ll
learn how to use each part in turn.
```
## Getting Started

```
To start out, you need to create your crew. First,
work through the Character Creation chapter
of the core rulebook (p.12). If you have
miniatures already picked out, go ahead and
choose species for each character; otherwise
you can use the First-timer, Standard, or
Random methods, as you prefer.
```
**1.** _Roll up your characters one at a time using_
    _whichever method you are happy with, and_
    _assign miniatures for each of them. Choose_
    _fitting names for everybody._
**2.** _Remember to figure out how many story_
    _points you have and write down all of your_
    _details on the record sheets from the back_
    _of the book._
       **3.** _If you start out with Patrons, Rumors or_
          _Rivals, set them aside but keep track of_
          _them. These mechanics are not introduced_
          _until you have a bit more experience._

## Your First Fight

```
As you return from shore leave, your crew is
ready and raring to go. You’ve been grounded
for a while now, waiting for the navigation
computer to be reset, and there’s only so
much gambling you can do before you end up
bored, broke, or shot.
When you start walking towards the shipyard,
you realize that the workers are looking
nervous and tense. Something is amiss. As
you turn the corner, you see a gang of local
scumbags hoping to make their name by
taking you out. This will be a good opportunity
to practice your skills, it seems.
No campaign steps are done this turn. Before
you proceed, read the core rulebook on how
to move and shoot with your characters
(pp.37-48; the Weapons Table, p.50; and any
special gear you have, pp.53-58).
Once you have created your crew, it is time to
get them into a fight. Don’t worry – this is a
training battle to help you learn the basics of
how to fight in Five Parsecs From Home.
```
**Introductory**

**Campaign**


_We are not using any of the campaign
rules at this point. Consult the “Set up the
Battlefield” section of the core rulebook
(p.108) to learn how to set up a table for play.
Don’t worry about Deployment Conditions,
Notable Sights, objectives or anything else.
Just focus on creating a fun and pleasing-
looking battlefield to fight over._

This is a straight-up fight against an enemy
gang. The enemy consists of Starport Scum
and a Specialist. as shown in the stats
block above.

_Once you have set everything up, review
the Battle Round mechanics (core rulebook,
p.112) to see how rolling your Reaction
dice works. Don’t worry about Seizing the
Initiative – we are not using that rule yet._

The fight goes on until every opponent is
removed from the table, you are completely
defeated, or you manage to flee the table by
moving across a battlefield edge.

Any of your crew members that were knocked
out during the fight are assumed to recover
just fine. No experience points or other post-
battle functions are carried out. Simply gather
up your terrain, and prepare for your first real
campaign turn!

## Campaign Turn 1

```
Jobs are a bit hard to come by, but your
mechanic tells you they know a guy who
needs some dirty work done. A squad of
security robots have been hacked and are now
firing on anyone that approaches, so he needs
someone to go in and blow them to pieces. It’s
a bad job, but it’s a paying job, and that’s what
you need right now.

If you are feeling confident, have a fifth bot show up at the center of the enemy battlefield edge
at the start of Round 3. If you do this, give +1 XP to the crew member that destroys the fifth bot.
Note : These enemies use a different AI type than the scum in the last battle (see the Defensive
Enemy Movement AI type p.43).

With a little coin in your pocket, it’s time to
start making some preparations. Back when
the ship crashed on Terseus-9, you lost a lot
of your old gear, and if you are going to take
on more challenging jobs, you’ll need to
know the lie of the land. You found a small
mercenary job to take on: some isolationist
colonists have turned militant and are
threatening to blow up a hyper-rail station.

If you received Patrons during character
creation, roll up a job for each of them now and
pick the one you’d like to take this campaign
turn. The other jobs do not generally remain
available, but each Patron will add a +1 bonus
when rolling to get a Patron job in future turns.

You may have obtained Rumors either during
character creation or from event tables. If so,
pay attention to World Step 5 (p.85) where
you will roll to see if they lead you to a Quest.
Once they do, you can pursue the Quest at
any time. Unlike a Patron job, it is not time-

but you’ll be fine, kid. Unless you won’t. Either
way... see you at the next starport.

Before the Battle
Go through the full sequence listed on p.68 of
the core rulebook. You may travel if you like.

The Battle
You will use all the standard rules in the
rulebook to generate your encounter this turn.
No more training wheels, spacer!

After the Battle
Complete the full post-battle sequence listed
on p.68 of the core rulebook.
```
```
Onwards and Upwards
Congratulations, you have completed the
tutorial game, and are now ready to continue
your campaign and explore the universe.
If you would like to use the Story Track, read
p.153 of the core rulebook and set the clock
to 5 Ticks. Collect 2 story points for making it
this far.
```

```
Heavily populated worlds often teem with
interest groups vying for political, economic,
and social dominance over the population.
Any major starport, settlement, or city is likely
to feature several such groups. Some operate
covertly while others are aggressive and open
about their intentions. Whether your crew
encounters factions in a seedy downtown bar
or through an anonymous message, they offer
a way to get involved in the power struggles of
the powerful and the desperate.
A Faction is a group or organization that seeks
to gain influence and control over the region in
which it resides. This can range from corporate
interests, merchant cartels, and social interest
groups to criminal gangs and secret societies.
For gameplay purposes, we are only
concerned with planetary Factions. Each
Faction exists primarily on a single world
(though the reach and influence may extent
throughout the system).
Factions offer players new options to get
involved in the world as well as having the
world get involved with them.
```
## EXPANDED FACTIONS

```
When creating a new world, generate 1D3+1
Factions as well. These represent the dominant
power groups that are at odds with each other
on the world. While numerous other groups
will exist, they are assumed to be secondary to
the Factions you create.
```
```
For each Faction, go through the process below,
beginning with a D100 roll for Faction type:
```
```
D100
```
```
FACTION
TYPE INFL. POWER
```
```
01-10 Charismatic
leader
+0 +0
```
```
11-30
Merchant
cartel +1 +0
```
```
31-50
Criminal
enterprise
+0 +1
```
```
51-60 Advocacy
group
+0 +0
```
```
61-75
Political
movement +0 +1
```
```
76-90
Religious
movement
+1 +0
```
```
91-00 Secretive
organization
+1 +1
```
```
Faction Type gives the broad narrative lean of
the organization. The categories are quite wide
and can encompass almost anything you can
think of within each type. Bear in mind that
Fringe society is quite alien to ours, and have
issues and concerns that may appear quite
abstract to us.
Each Faction is rated for two qualities:
Influence and Power. Roll 1D3+1 for each of
these qualities, and note them down, applying
any modifiers from the Faction type.
```
# EXPANDED

# FACTIONS

## Scenarios & Settings


_-_ **_Influence_** _can be seen as a measure of_
    _practical size. Factions with major Influence_
    _have a large membership (or a smaller_
    _number of more powerful members), assets,_
    _resources, and public recognition.
-_ **_Power_** _is the mailed fist of the Faction,_
    _indicating how well it can take action against_
    _other Factions, whether through political,_
    _economic, or clandestine means. Of course,_
    _in Fringe space, “clandestine” can often_
    _mean “open gun battle”._

Faction Loyalty
The relationship between a Faction and a crew
is measured by a **Loyalty** score. As a crew
accumulates Loyalty, they gain more trust
with the Faction and are viewed as a reliable
asset (or at least a useful one). Your crew has a
separate Loyalty score for each Faction.

If you began the campaign on this world,
you may choose one Faction to start at
**Loyalty 1**. The rest begin at **Loyalty 0**. If you
are off-worlders, all Loyalties begin at 0.

## Faction Jobs

```
Like Patrons , Factions often have a need for
things to get done. and they would not hire a
freelancer crew unless this required a certain
degree of violence.
Before taking your crew tasks, each turn your
captain may check for a Faction job. This does
not count as a crew task and can be done
even if your captain is in Sick Bay, though not
if they are currently absent from the crew for
other reasons.
Select a Faction you would like to work for and
roll 1D6. If the roll is equal to or below the
Influence score of the Faction, they have a job
available. You can generate all details before
deciding whether to take it or not.
Faction jobs are treated as a Patron job,
but do not roll for Danger Pay or Benefits.
Factions only ask if there is a serious need:
Add 1 additional standard opponent to the
enemy force you will face.
```

## Affiliated Patron jobs

```
Many Patron jobs will be affiliated with a
Faction either directly or indirectly. Whenever
you receive a job from a new Patron, Roll a D6 :
1-4: It is a normal job.
5-6: The patron is affiliated with a randomly
selected Faction. They may be a
subsidiary, a friendly organization,
or acting under influence.
Affiliated Patron jobs are still Patron jobs
and are less likely to increase your Loyalty
rating with the Faction in question, but they
do count as being a successful Faction job
for the purpose of any post-game resolution
mechanics.
```
## Gaining Loyalty

```
Factions recognize the value of competent
agents. If you Win a Faction Job mission, roll
1D6 when resolving Patron and Rival details
after the mission:
```
_- If the roll is_ below _your current_ **_Loyalty_**
    _score, it remains the same.
- If the roll is_ equal to or higher than _your_
    _current_ **_Loyalty_** _score, it is raised by_
    **_+1 point_**_._

```
If this was an Affiliated Patron job, a roll of a 6
earns +1 Loyalty.
Unlike Patrons , Factions are generally in it for
the long haul, and as such Loyalty does not
decrease from a failed Job.
```
```
The Benefits of Loyalty
Having friends is important. Your captain may
try to call in a favor once per campaign turn.
This requires a crew task, and can only be done
by your captain.
Roll a D6 :
```
_- If the roll is_ equal to or below _the current_
    **_Loyalty_** _score, reduce the Loyalty by the_
    _die roll, and select one of the favors listed_
    _below. You can choose the favor after rolling.
- If the roll is_ higher _than the Loyalty score,_
    _nobody has time for you (“...but we do_
    _appreciate your business!” Your Loyalty score_
    _remains unchanged._

```
FACTION FAVOR NOTES
```
```
Pulling strings
Can be used to cancel a Loan enforcement roll (see p.154) or remove an
Enforcer, Vigilante, or Bounty Hunter Rival.
```
```
Monetary help
Gain Credits equal to the die roll. Add +1 to the score if the sum is used
directly to pay off debts or medical expenses.
```
```
Contact network
You may either roll up a Patron that offers a job or opt to take a Salvage job
(see p.137).
```
```
Arrange a meeting
```
```
Roll up a new crew member using the start-of-campaign process. They will
assist you for one mission. If you win, they will offer to join you permanently for
a one-time payment of 1D6 Credits.
Provide cover You cannot be attacked by any Rivals this turn.
Access to information Gain Quest Clues equal to Influence this turn.
```
## Playing All Sides

```
Freelancers tend to work on the
periphery of Faction power structures
and tend to do a good job at keeping
their cards close to their chest. For this
reason, your crew can attain Loyalty in
multiple Factions.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


## Faction Activities

During the Check for Invasion step of each
campaign turn, the Factions will perform
activities if the world is not currently
being invaded.

If you did a job directly for a Faction, always
perform the Faction Struggle event. This
does not occur for affiliated jobs. Once this
is resolved, one randomly selected Faction
performs an activity. This can be the same
Faction again and could even be another
Faction Struggle.

To determine the activity, roll **D100** and
consult the Faction Activity table one the
following page.

```
Note: Some activities have requirements. If the
Faction does not meet these, the action does
not take place, and nothing happens.
Some activities target another Faction. This is
selected randomly.

```
## Off-World Factions

```
If you are running a particularly ambitious
campaign and keeping track of multiple
worlds, a Faction activity occurs on each
game world you are following in your
campaign. However, you can choose to let a
former world “sleep” if you would rather not
be overwhelmed.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


## Invasion!?

```
If the world is invaded, Factions typically flee
off-world or dissolve. Once you know where
you are ending up, roll 1D6 for each Faction
with a Power of 4 or less :
```
_- If the roll is_ below _their Power, they flee to_
    _the same world but suffer_ **-1 Power** _and_
    **-1 Influence** _(to a_ **minimum of 1** _each)_
       _- If the roll is_ equal to or higher than _their_
          **Power** _, the Faction is destroyed in the_
          _invasion or scatters to the winds. Either way,_
          _they are not a factor any longer._
       If any Faction has a **Power** of **5+** , they will
       instead help fight it out. Each such Faction
       adds **+1** to the **Galactic War Progress table**.
       If the world is reclaimed, such Factions suffer
       **-2 Power** but gain **+1 Influence**. Generate
       **two new Factions** when the war ends.

## Faction Events

```
After rolling for crew and campaign events,
roll D100 on the following table for a
Faction event.
If a specific Faction needs to be determined,
pick one at random from the Factions on the
current world.
```
## Fringe World Strife

```
(See page 148)
A Crackdown prevents all Faction activities
this turn.
If an Economic Collapse takes place,
all Factions suffer -1 Influence.
If a Civil War breaks out, Factions will
go to ground until the war is over.

```
Two Factions are having it out in the streets. Randomly select both and
roll 1D6+Power. The loser cannot offer a job next turn and cannot

```
```
A random Faction sends you on a Quest targeting one of their enemies.
If you complete it successfully, the target Faction suffers -1 Influence
and -1 Power. You receive +2 Loyalty for completing the Quest.
```
## Faction Destruction

If _either_ **Power** or **Influence** is reduced to **0** ,
the Faction ceases to exist. All Loyalty is
removed.

If a Faction was destroyed by a Faction Struggle
and you had **Loyalty** of **4+** to the winner, you
receive a **Rival** (from the Hired Muscle table)
as vengeful elements of the defeated Faction

```
go after you to settle some scores. If you took
a Faction job for the winner in the same battle
round, add +2 Loyalty.
Every time a Faction is destroyed, every
remaining Faction rolls 1D6+Power. The
highest score gains +1 Influence (on a draw,
both receive +1 Influence ).

# Mission

# Selection

## Scenarios & Settings


**STEALTH MISSIONS**

While stealth is applicable to a range of
situations such as a military outpost or a
well-guarded research lab, it comes into its
own in the concrete and chrome hell of a
major urban center, where corporate facilities
and gang hideouts are frequent targets for
hostile intent.

Sometimes you need to go in commando-style
without getting detected, whether it is due
to the risk of overwhelming enemy forces, or
an employer who would prefer to not cause a
scene. Whether scouting some dark corner of a
planetary metropolis, or striking a key level of
a space hulk in high orbit, Stealth missions are
well suited to a more patient freelancer who
isn’t afraid of crawling around in the dark.

Integration

_- Enemy Deployment Variables (p.44) are not_
    _used in Stealth missions.
- Escalating Battles (p.46) do not apply during_
    _Stealth rounds or in the first battle round.
- Stealth missions require the conventional_
    _miniatures rules, and are not compatible_
    _with Grid-based Movement (p.90) or_
    _No-minis Combat Resolution (p.66)._

## Stealth Basics

In a Stealth mission, you will be trying to
achieve a special objective from the **Stealth
Mission Objectives** table below. During the
mission you will try to infiltrate the target
location without being detected, while
contending with various security measures.

If you are detected, the mission turns into a
conventional battle as you must try to complete
the objective while dealing with arriving
enemy forces.

## Table Setup

```
Stealth missions require a fairly dense table
with lots of terrain. Try to avoid any large open
spaces as stealth is more exciting when there
are lots of things to hide behind.
Stealth missions assume a 3 x 3-foot play
area (36 x 36”). For 2 x 2-foot tables, consider
halving all distances and ranges.
Any terrain feature placed in the center of the
table must be something that can be climbed
or entered such as a building, forest, or ruin.
You may leave the center empty if you prefer.
```
## Objectives

```
The normal process for determining objectives
and other scenario features is not used.
Instead, roll D100 on the table below to
determine what your objective will be.
Unless it must be located first, the objective is
placed in the exact center of the table.
```
```
Exfiltration
Once the objective has been achieved, the crew
must leave the battlefield. This can be done by
moving across any table edge.
Stealth missions are often fought in conditions
of poor visibility and so it is easier to slip away
in the confusion. When rolling for initiative
each turn, you may select a single crew
member assigned a 6 and remove them from
play. They have exfiltrated successfully and
cannot return to the battlefield. You may use
this option before the objective has
been completed.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


```
D100 OBJECTIVE NOTES
```
```
01-20 Locate and retrieve
An item must be located using the “Finding the target” rules
below. Once located, it must be picked up and then exfiltrated.
```
```
21-35 Deliver item
An item must be delivered to the objective. Select which crew
member carries it. Once it is delivered, the crew can exfiltrate.
```
```
36-50 Locate and contact
```
```
An individual must be located using the “Finding the target” rules
below. Once located, you must move within 3” and Line of Sight,
and then exfiltrate.
```
```
51-70 Rescue individual
```
```
An individual is placed at the objective. You must reach within 3”
and Line of Sight of them, at which point they join your crew for the
rest of the mission. You must exfiltrate them.
```
```
71-85 Transmit message
```
```
An individual is placed at the objective. You must reach within
3” and Line of Sight to deliver the message and get a reply, then
exfiltrate.
```
```
86-00 Retrieve package
An item is placed at the objective. It must be picked up and then
exfiltrated.
```
```
Finding the target
If the target must be located, mark or take a
note of any terrain features within 6” of the
table center. Any of them could contain the
target. You may have to relocate some features
to ensure you have at least three candidates, or
you can place markers in an open area.
When a crew member moves within 6” and
Line of Sight of a terrain feature or marker that
is a candidate, roll 1D6+Savvy.
```
_- A_ **_6+_** _indicates they have located the_
    _target: Place it within or on the feature (if_
    _possible), or adjacent otherwise. It should_
    _be at the most distant point from the figure_
    _discovering it.
- A result of_ **_5 or less_** _means the feature does_
    _not contain the target._
Once you are down to the last possible
feature, it will of course contain the target
automatically.

## Items

```
Carrying a mission item does not hinder the
character’s ability to move and fight. An item
can be handed off during movement as a
free action simply by moving within 1” of the
recipient, but can only be handed off once per
battle round (you cannot “fire brigade” the
item off the table in a chain).
If a character carrying an item becomes a
casualty, it is dropped where they fell and
may be picked up by moving into contact.
Enemies will ignore items on the ground, and
they are unaffected by other factors such as
Area weapons. However, an item dropped in
dangerous or hazardous terrain (such as a pool
of acid) is destroyed.
```
## Why a Savvy Test?

```
A high-Savvy character is more likely to
have correctly guessed where the target
is located.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


## Individuals

Generate the type of Individual using the table
below. Regardless of title, the profile is:

```
REACTIONS 1
SPEED 4”
COMBAT SKILL +0
TOUGHNESS 4
SAVVY +1
```
Any Individual from this table moves their
base Speed in a random direction at the end
of each Enemy Phase. The enemy will ignore
Individuals normally – they are under strict
orders not to harm them, or the Individual is
fitted with stealth equipment or has psionic
shielding). However, if third party creatures
such as vent crawlers are spawned during
the mission, they WILL attack Individuals.

**Special notes:**

_- Individuals are unaware of any dangers_
    _they could stumble into, though they_
    _will halt at dangerous terrain features or_
    _environmental hazards.
- Individuals are not armed. You can give_
    _them a weapon you are carrying, but once_
    _armed, they will be treated as a normal_
    _target by the enemy._
       _- If Individuals are caught by an Area weapon,_
          _they are struck normally and, if surviving_
          _this or any other type of attack, they will_
          _Dash to the nearest terrain feature and hide_
          _there for the rest of the game._

```
D100 INDIVIDUAL
01-15 Criminal kingpin
16-30 Corporate agent
31-45 Notable citizen
46-55 Off-world diplomat
56-70 Leader of organization
71-80 Local government employee
81-90 Wealthy local
91-00 Law enforcement
```
## They Did What?

```
During a Rescue mission it is possible for
the random movement of the Individual to
wander off the table edge. In this case, they
count as having been Rescued, even though
they evidently had to rescue themselves!
Other mission types are failed if the Individual
wanders off the table – they make their
escape, enemy agents pick them up, they are
eaten by vent crawlers, etc.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


## Deployment

```
Enemy deployment
Enemy forces are deployed evenly throughout
the table. If possible, for every four enemies,
one should be placed on a raised terrain
feature such as a roof-top, walkway, or tower.
```
```
Player arrival
The crew arrives from a single randomly
selected table edge, moving onto the table in
the first battle round. Crew members must all
arrive from the same edge but do not have to
arrive from the same point. Pick each point of
arrival as you move the figures on.
```
## The Stealth Round

```
Until the alarm has been set off, each battle
round is played as a Stealth round. Initiative
dice are rolled and assigned as normal.
During Stealth rounds, movement takes place
at the following rates (Dashing is unavailable):
```
_-_ **Quick Actions Phase: Base move +1”**
_-_ **Slow Actions Phase: Base move -1”**
During Stealth rounds, Enemies do not use
their AI. Instead:
_1. Randomly select_ **_one_** _enemy figure that will_
    _remain in place, scan in every direction (see_
    **_Field of Vision_** _diagrams_ **_1a_** _, below), and_
    _then face in a random direction (_ **_1b_** _,_ **_2_** _).
2. Each remaining enemy figure moves in a_
    _random direction at their_ **base move -1”** _,_
    _facing in the direction they move each turn_
    _(_ **_2_** _, below). Note: These enemies_ **_do not_**
    **_“pan”_** _their viewpoint when they turn to_
    _move in a new direction. They are assumed_
    _to only look in the direction they are_
    _moving, regardless of their original position.
3. An enemy that would move into a wall,_
    _terrain feature, or the table edge will remain_
    _in place instead of moving (_ **_3_** _, below), scan_
    _in every direction and then turn to face_
    _directly away from the obstacle in question._

```
1a
```
```
2
```
```
1b
One designated
enemy figure
```
```
Designated figure makes a
360-degree Field of Vision scan
```
```
All except designated figure make
base move+1 in a random direction
```
```
During a Stealth round, enemy figures have
no active Field of Vision while turning
```
```
The figure in red could not
complete its move (it would
have crossed the table edge),
so remains in place, faces away, and
makes a 360-degree Field of Vision scan
```
```
3
```
```
The rest have 90-degree Field of Vision
in their facing direction.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


Detection
The crew risks detection in the following
circumstances:

_- While a crew member moves, if any part of_
    _the move lies within Line of Sight and the_
    _Field of Vision of an enemy.
- If a crew member is within Line of Sight and_
    _Field of Vision at the end of an enemy move.
- If a crew member is within Line of Sight_
    _when an enemy scans (remember, scanning_
    _is in every direction)._

To determine if the crew figure is detected,
roll **2D6** for the enemy in question.
**Subtract 1** if the enemy is scanning.

An enemy can potentially spot multiple
crew members at risk of detection. A single
roll is made with the score being compared
individually to each exposed crew member.

The modified roll is the **spotting value** of
that enemy this round. The spotting value is
**reduced by 2** if the figure is partially
obscured by a terrain feature that they are
within or in contact with, and **reduced by 1**
for _each_ intervening feature that would
obscure visibility.

```
For each crew figure at risk, measure the range
from the enemy. Round any fractions down to a
whole inch (so 6.3" is 6").
```
_- If the spotting value_ **exceeds** _the distance_
    _to any visible crew figure, they are spotted,_
    _and the alarm is raised immediately._
    _See “Alarm!”, below.
- If the spotting value_ **equals** _the distance_
    _to any crew figure, but none are spotted,_
    _the enemy is suspicious. They immediately_
    _move_ **_1”_** _towards the crew figure in_
    _question, facing towards them, and roll_
    _again. They are not considered to be_
    _scanning when this occurs. If two crew_
    _figures are at the same distance, move_
    _towards one of them, picked at random._
    _This can occur multiple times in a row.
- If the spotting value is_ **below** _the distance to_
    _every crew figure at risk, none are spotted._

```
Tools and tricks
During Stealth rounds, you can take
advantage of any of three options:
Stay Down , Distraction , and Lure.
Each requires a crew member to remain
stationary to perform them.
```
```
OPTION DESCRIPTION
```
```
Stay Down
```
```
The character tries to be as discreet as possible. Until the character activates again, all
spotting rolls against them are reduced by the character’s Savvy bonus , provided they
are at least partially obscured by terrain.
```
```
Distraction
```
```
Select an enemy within 6” and roll 1D6+Savvy. On a 6+ , they turn immediately in the
chosen direction. When next activated, they remain in place, looking in that direction, and
take no other actions. If the roll is a natural 1 , the enemy immediately turns to face the
distracting crew member and makes a spotting roll.
```
```
Lure
```
```
The crew member tries to draw enemies towards their position. Every enemy within
8” immediately moves 1D6” towards the location of the crew member and then makes
a spotting check. Each enemy moves individually, but a single spotting roll is made and
applied to every enemy.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


```
Attacking while in Stealth
A crew member may opt to attack either by
moving into Brawling combat or by firing
a weapon.
A crew member that attacks from outside
the field of vision of an enemy receives a
+2 bonus to their shooting or Brawling
combat roll.
Attacks will set off the alarm if:
```
_- A weapon other than a handgun or needle_
    _rifle is fired.
- A target of a shot or Brawling attack is not_
    _knocked out by the attack.
- A Ripper sword is used in Brawling combat._

```
Alarm!
When the alarm goes off, the current Stealth
round ends immediately, and the game
transitions to normal combat. Begin a new
battle round normally. In some cases, the
alarm may be raised before a Stealth round
is completed. When this happens, end
the Stealth round without completing any
missing actions.
Randomly select a table edge which the enemy
reinforcements will be arriving from.
```
## Reinforcements

```
At the beginning of each battle round, roll
2D6. For each die showing a 6 , a basic enemy
arrives as reinforcements at the center of the
enemy table edge (selected above). Arriving
enemies are placed immediately, but cannot
take any actions in the battle round in which
they arrive.
```
## Stealth Mission Enemies

```
Enemy types are determined normally, with
Roving Threats being treated as Hired Muscle
instead. Enemies with Rampage AI should be
rerolled (they’re a little too energetic to make
viable guards).
The initial number of enemies is not rolled for.
Instead, the enemy will automatically have a
total number of figures equal to your campaign
crew size +1 (so 7 in a normal game). These
will include 1 Specialist and 1 Lieutenant.
The rest (as well as any reinforcements) will be
basic troops.
```
## Psionics and Stealth

```
(See Psionics Powers, pp.18-19)
```
_- Any Psionic use targeting an enemy_
    _(_ **Grab** _,_ **Shock** _,_ **Psionic Scare** _) will set off_
    _the alarm unless they are removed from_
    _play as a result.
-_ **Predict** _can be used to roll twice for an_
    _enemy spotting roll.
-_ **Shroud** _counts as a terrain feature (_ **_-2 to_**
    **_spotting values_** _), but does not block Line_
    _of Sight._

## Scenarios & Settings


**STREET FIGHTS**

Sooner or later, your freelancers will find
themselves in some back-alley shootout.
While most combat takes place in a relatively
known area where the only people present
are you and the enemy force, street fighting
is confused and muddled. Characters slip
into and out of sight, it is difficult to confirm
whether you hit your mark, and something
unexpected lies around every corner.

Integration
Notable Sights and Deployment Conditions are
not used in Street Fighting scenarios, and they
use their own Objectives listed below.

Enemy Deployment Variables (p.44) are not
used in Street Fights.

Escalating Battles (p.46) are not used in
Street Fights.

## Fire in the Streets

It is easy to underestimate how much “stuff”
is in a city back alley, from dumpsters to
a motorcycle to some random trash to
a newspaper stand. The future may be
different (a robo-cycle leaning against a
robo-dumpster behind some robo-trash,
no doubt), but the sort of colony towns
that have frequent jobs for freelancers are
probably similarly cluttered. This kind of
detail makes it difficult to depict the table
accurately since the demands on your terrain
collection would be enormous. The rules in
this chapter help provide some abstractions
to how the entire thing works, so you don’t
have to build an entire city block in intricate
detail (unless you want to, of course!)

Combat in a street setting is a series of high
activity bursts followed by periods of ducking
behind something and trying to see what is
going on. A laser beam can come from any
corner, and movement is often methodical and
cautious to avoid stepping into an ambush.

```
When playing a Street Fight scenario on the
gaming table, we use an abstracted approach
to time and space. Two figures in one location
may trade shots representing only a few
seconds of time, while another figure goes to
investigate something and has a conversation
with an informant. When they meet up, their
time “catches up” and they are now acting
together. Don’t over-analyze it too much, just
think of it in film terms.
```
## Building a Table

```
You will need to mark off streets and alleys,
though nothing stops you from having a
shootout in a construction site or across a
town plaza. Since filling a table with buildings
is expensive (not to mention a bit difficult
to game on), paper or card can be cut out to
form building blocks and placed to form your
streets and alleys.
You can make some buildings accessible by
marking entrance points and then drawing in a
few rooms. Don’t worry about making an entire
city block detailed with all the apartments
and shops. Just outline a room or two that
characters can gain access to.
It is fine to leave some or all of the city blocks
inaccessible as citizens would lock the doors
when they hear trouble, but make sure there is
plenty of ways in and out of locations.
You will also need lots of incidental terrain to
clutter up the streets and side alleys. Again,
if you are on a budget, you can cut out paper
squares and mark them as “tall” (blocks sight)
or “short” (blocks movement but allows sight),
and scatter them everywhere.
Take a moment to determine what the
buildings are: It can make all the difference to
the narrative feel of the mission. If in doubt,
roll D6 on the table below and apply the result
to a block.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


```
D6 BUILDING EFFECT
1-2 Commercial (shops, offices) +1 City marker
3-4 Residential (apartments, houses) No special effects
5 Warehouse +1 Suspect marker
```
```
6 Abandoned or empty
No special effects, but place plenty of difficult terrain
and additional cover nearby.
```
```
Visibility
Street scenes are chaotic and confusing as
street clutter, passing crowds, and hover cars
obscure vision. Of course, it is probably also
raining dramatically in the neon-lit night
scene. All visibility is limited to 9” in a street
fight scenario, and cannot be increased by any
abilities or equipment.
```
```
Placing Suspect Markers
In a Street Fight, you must identify where the
enemy is. All enemies begin the game as
Suspect markers which may turn out to be
opposition as you play. The mission begins
with Suspect markers equal to the number of
characters the player deploys.
The markers are placed around the table,
spaced out fairly evenly. Suspects should be
along the side of the street, near shops or any
other interesting features you may have noted.
Place an additional Suspect marker by the
entrance to any Warehouses on the map.
```
```
Placing City Markers
City markers represent city life in general, and
are detailed fully on p.133. If this is your first
time playing a Street Fight scenario, you may
prefer to omit their use. Otherwise, place
6 City markers around the table in or by any
suitable terrain feature or building block. Place
an additional marker by any Commercial area.
```
## Determine Player Entry

```
In street fights, your crew is likely to have been
undertaking various tasks and minor jobs and
are now converging on their objective. Some
may have followed leads or done research,
while another may have stopped to get a neo-
dog from a street vendor.
Each crew figure enters from a random point
on the edge of the table. A direction die can be
rolled in the center of the table to determine
each arrival. Place each figure at the edge of
the table where the direction die points.
Your crew captain arrives last, and may choose
to arrive randomly or alongside any crew
member already placed on the table.
```
## Encountering Suspects

```
Suspect markers behave randomly as their
nature is not certain yet. It may be one of
your opponents out to pick a fight, it may be
a random bystander that was just moving
suspiciously, or even a particularly noisy
service bot.
Suspect markers act in the Enemy Phase,
after all active enemy figures have acted. They
are moved in order from left to right on the
gaming table. One at a time, roll a D6 and carry
out the action shown on the table below:
```
## PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY

```
If you prefer a more challenging game,
add 1 or 2 additional Suspect markers.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


```
D6 ACTION R E S U LT
1 Stay Remain in place.
2-4 Move Move 4” in a random direction, halting if unable to make the full move.
```
```
5 Pursue
```
```
Move 4” towards the nearest crew member by the shortest route possible.
The Suspect marker continues to be in pursuit in future rounds and
does not roll on this table any longer.
```
```
6
Something
interesting?
```
```
The marker remains where it is. Place a City marker underneath it. This can only
occur once per round. If multiple Suspect markers all roll a 6 , the City marker is only
placed the first time. Treat the rest as entry 1: Stay.
```
If a crew member ever finds themself within
Line of Sight and within a distance of **4+Savvy
inches** of a Suspect marker, the Suspect is
identified; for example, a character **Savvy +1**
spots at **5”** range. Roll **D6** immediately, and
consult the table below.

```
Note that this can happen both when a Suspect
marker moves and when a crew figure moves.
Halt the move at the earliest possible point
it would meet the criteria, and resolve it
immediately before completing the action of
the crew figure if it was interrupted.
```
```
D6 SUSPECT R E S U LT
1 Nothing interesting Remove the marker.
```
```
2 Possible enemy
If the marker is in pursuit (see ‘Pursue’, above table), it is an enemy.
Otherwise, it is nothing of interest. In either case, remove the marker.
3-5 Enemy Remove the marker and replace it with an enemy figure.
```
```
6 Ambush
```
```
Remove the marker and replace it with an enemy figure,
then place a second enemy 6” away from the spotting crew member
in a random direction.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


```
Evasion
The city is full of places to hide or make an
escape, if you know what you are doing.
A crew member is eligible to Evade if they had
no enemies visible at the start of the Enemy
Actions phase. If a moving enemy comes into
sight, they may attempt to Evade immediately
upon the enemy figure moving into sight and
visual range:
Roll 1D6+Savvy. For every point above 4 ,
the crew member may immediately move
1” in any direction. For example, on a modified
result of 6 , the crew member could move 2”. A
modified result of 4 or less means the attempt
failed and no Evasion movement is done.
Evasion moves can cross any terrain
features that could normally be traversed,
without penalty. You cannot Evade into
Brawling combat.
A figure can only attempt to Evade once per
battle round.
```
## Objectives

```
Roll D100 on the table below to determine
what you are getting paid to do.
```
```
Individuals
Several missions involve an Individual. This
character always uses the base character profile
( Speed 4” , Toughness 3 ), and will
not fight.
They move at the end of the Enemy Actions
phase and will wander in a random direction.
If a figure within 6” and Line of Sight fires or is
fired upon, they panic and immediately run a
full move away from the incident and towards
some sort of cover. They will then resume
wandering at the end of each Enemy Action
phase as normal.
A character within 3” and Line of Sight of
an individual can corral them to move in a
particular direction. This requires a roll of
1D6+Savvy , scoring a 5+. They will then
move to a designated location within Line of
Sight before resuming their wandering.
If used, Individuals begin the scenario in the
center of the table.
```
```
Packages
If a mission involves a Package , it costs 1” of
movement to pick it up off the ground, place it
in a location or hand it off.
If a character becomes Down while carrying a
Package, it drops at their feet. Roll D6 ; a roll of
1 indicates it is destroyed, making the mission
a failure.
```
## Starting Trouble

```
Any revealed enemies that are unable to
spot any crew members after moving will try
to start trouble. Roll 1D6 : On a 1 , a Suspect
marker is placed randomly 6” from their
position. Only one new marker can be placed
each battle round regardless of how many 1 s
are rolled.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


**D100 OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION**

```
01-10
Contact
individual
```
```
You must reach the individual and move within 1” to deliver the message.
Once it is delivered, the individual is removed from the table, and the
figure that delivered the message must survive the mission (meaning not
permanently dead).
```
```
11-20
Locate
individual
```
```
The individual does not begin on the table. Place 6 markers around the table
in buildings or interesting locations, spread roughly evenly (use markers, dice,
or other tokens that you can identify as ‘Individual markers’).
Each time you move within 4” and Line of Sight of a marker, remove it and
roll a D6. If the roll is equal to or below the number of markers removed so far
(including the present one) you have located the individual.
Finally, You must get the individual off a table edge without them becoming a
casualty to save them.
```
```
21-40
Surveil
individual
```
```
You must end a total of 3 battle rounds with a figure within Line of Sight and
4-9” from the individual, then make your escape.
If the individual ever comes within 3” and Line of Sight, they panic and will
flee towards the nearest table edge until they no longer have Line of Sight, at
which point they resume wandering. You can resume surveillance after they
resume wandering, but cannot do so while they are Panicked.
```
```
41-60 Confront
individual
```
```
You must reach the individual and move within 2”. Once you do, roll 1D6 :
1-2: They are terrified and will attempt to flee, running towards the nearest
table edge on each activation. You must defeat them in a Brawl (without
claiming any weapon bonuses), at which point they surrender and are
removed from play. The mission is completed.
3-4: They want to make a fight of it. Roll on the Street Combatants Table
(p.132) to see what they turn out to have been (they were obviously in
disguise). You must turn them into a casualty to complete the mission.
5-6: They must be threatened. Roll 1D6+Savvy , with a 6+ succeeding.
You can try any time you have a character within 2” ; the individual will
continue to wander until you succeed, at which point they are removed
from play and the mission is completed.
```
```
61-75
Rescue
individual
```
```
You must reach the individual and corral them. Once you have, once per battle
round a crew member that is within 1” of the individual can move them in any
direction desired.
They do not move individually. If they spend an entire battle round with no
crew figures within 6” at any point, they panic and will move to the nearest
cover to sit tight.
Once you have contacted the individual, the nearest Suspect marker will
Pursue (see table, p.125) and enemies may attack the individual in Brawling
combat (but not by firing).
You must get the individual off a table edge to save them.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


```
D100 OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION
```
```
76-90 Deliver package
```
```
Select a crew member to carry the package. It must be delivered to the center
of the table. No enemy or Suspect marker may be within 5” when the package
is placed. You must then make your escape.
Place an additional Suspect marker on the center of the table.
```
```
91-00
Retrieve
package
```
```
A package is placed in the center of the table. Place a Suspect marker on top
of the initial location. If the distance from the table edge to the center is less
than 15” , place a second Suspect marker 6” from the center in a random
direction.
A character must move into contact with the package, and it must then be
moved off any table edge.
```
## The Shootout

```
A Street Fight is a busy and often
claustrophobic environment and characters
fighting with large, cumbersome weapons are
often at a distinct disadvantage compared to
a pistol that can be whipped from a jacket and
fired single-handed. Special advantages apply
to figures using Pistols as explained below.
When an attacker fires a weapon with the Pistol
trait, a Shootout is initiated:
```
_1. The attacker fires normally.
2. If the target is not_ Stunned _or eliminated,_
    _they may return fire IF they are armed with_
    _a_ Pistol_.
3. If the attacker is not_ Stunned _or eliminated_
    _or the target does not have a_ Pistol _(or is_
    _otherwise unable to fire), the attacker fires a_
    _second time._
No additional shots are taken after carrying out
these three steps. The encounter then switches
to the usual combat rules.
Figures with non- _Pistol_ weapons can use them
normally in a street fight scenario but cannot
initiate a Shootout and cannot return fire as
part of a Shootout against them.

```
Casualties
Street fighting is confusing, and exchanges of
fire are often brief. It is recommended to use
the new Casualty tables on page 100.
```
```
Morale
Morale is not checked during Street Fights as
the situation is too confusing and enemies
may well be unaware of what is happening
elsewhere on the table.
```
## Street Fight Enemies

```
The streets have their own ecosystem of gangs
and bullies, only too ready to go toe-to-toe
with strangers muscling in on their turf.
Perhaps they’ve been paid to deal with you,
perhaps they just want to establish who’s boss.
For regular street foes, use the Street Fight
Enemies table below. However, there may be
tougher customers around: If a City Marker
reveal indicates that a combatant is present,
roll on the Street Combatant table instead
(see p.132).
```
## Scenarios & Settings


Street Fight Enemies table
Use this enemy table when selecting
opponents for a Street Fight scenario.

Street fight opposition does not generally
have leadership as it doesn’t operating
as a cohesive unit. The same profile and
armaments are used throughout the
mission.

The opposition is not determined until the
first time you reveal an Enemy during the
scenario.

```
Note that some entries are similar to entries on
the main encounter tables, but profiles may be
different here. Use the profiles below for Street
Fight scenarios only.

gang, and may fight each other as well as your crew.
23-32 Main Gang 4” +1 4 A Handgun
_Unity Enforcer slang classifies a Main Gang as one that has steady control over at least two full

- No special rules apply.
- If another gang shows up, they are automatically Main Gangers as well, but will be a rival
gang, and may fight each other as well as your crew.
33-40 Urban Separatists 4” +1 4 T Colony rifle
_Militant groups often decide that their particular neighborhood should secede from the colony
or even from Unity as a whole._

placed in the center of the battlefield. One will carry a rattle gun, while the other two carry
colony rifles.

## It’s a Weird Place

85-94 Terror Faction 4” +1 4 A Handgun; Blade
The distinction between Terror Factions and fanatics or separatists is that for the “Terrors” blowing
things up tends to be the primary goal.
```
- If a Terror member activates without a figure in sight, roll a **D6**. On a 1, they decide to blow
    up the nearest terrain feature or building. They move towards it each activation and try to
    enter (even if being fired upon, though they will shoot normally). If they activate within the
    terrain feature, a **Bomb marker** is placed, and a **D6** roll is made each activation (including
    the present). On a **1-2** , the bomb goes off. All figures in, on, or adjacent to the feature become
    casualties with no saving throw.
- Once a bomb goes off, the **Sirens!** event triggers automatically (see p.135).
- The bomb can be disarmed by moving into contact and rolling **6+** on a **Savvy test**.

95-100 Neon Barbarians 5” +1 5 A Boarding saber

```
While some worlds regress to a low tech environment, you occasionally get groups of city-
dwellers who decide to intentionally emulate such a lifestyle. This can lead to them roaming the
city streets, shouting at street lights and waving their swords around.
```
- Neon Barbarians respect a well-spoken individual. A crew member moving within **4”** can
    attempt a **Savvy test**. A **7+** means the Barbarians will ignore that character until the character
    attacks them.
- Barbarians receive **+1 Combat Skill** versus any opponent that has fired a gun at them.
- Note that any character carrying a sword of any kind will be challenged to fight, and cannot
    talk their way out of it. Blades, boarding sabers, glare swords, and ripper swords all count
    as swords.

## Resolving Enemies

If you know who or what you are opposed by
in the mission, each enemy is simply one of
that type.

If you are going into the area unaware of who
is out to get you, the first revealed enemy
requires a roll on the Street Fight Enemies
table (see p.129). All enemies placed due to
subsequent Suspect markers represent the
same enemy type.

City Markers
A city is a living, chaotic place, and this does not
change while a gun battle rages. City markers
represent the unpredictable aspect of a Street
Fight scenario. The first time you play, you may
wish to omit them to keep the scenario from
being too complicated. Of course, you may be
the type to jump right in!

```
If in use, at the end of the Slow Actions phase
roll 1D6 on the table below. Note: Roll only
once per turn , NOT for each individual marker.

```
- Add a **Quest Clue**!
31-40 Crowd _There must be a sale on._
- The crowd takes up a **4”x 4”** space and begins centered on the marker
(which now counts as a **Crowd marker** ).
- Roll randomly to determine which way they are going. They will move **4”** at the
end of each Enemy Actions phase and blocks all Line of Sight. A character that
ends up within the crowd must either stand still or move as the crowd moves,
being carried along. They cannot take any actions while within the crowd. The
crowd continues to move in the same direction. If they contact an obstacle they
halt and turn to a random direction.
- Firing on a character within Line of Sight of the crowd disperses them. It
also immediately starts the **Sirens!** entry on this table. (No, you cannot
deliberately fire on the crowd to disperse them. What kind of game do you
think you are playing?)
41-45 Roadblock _You can’t get there from here._
- An area **4”x4”** centered on the marker is impassable and cannot be fired

46-50 Bot-struction _Construction bots descend on the area._
- An area **4”x4”** centered on the marker is taken up by the bots.
- They will move randomly **4”** at the end of each Enemy Actions phase.
- The area cannot be moved or fired through. Characters caught in the
construction zone at any point must roll **1D6+Savvy** , requiring a **6+** to evade.
Failures are handled by the construction bots and become casualties.

    phase. They cannot be fired upon or attacked in any way.
- If, at any point, gunfire occurs within Line of Sight of the reporter, this starts the
    **Sirens!** entry on this table.
- Additionally, if a crew member fires a weapon or initiates a Brawl while in sight
    of the reporter, you receive an **Enforcer Rival**. This does not apply if returning
    fire in a Shootout, however.

of each of the four table edges. These markers are considered to be _in pursuit_
(see 'Pursue', p.125)
76-80 Gang turf _You notice the tell-tale signs of gang territory._
- At the end of the following battle round, randomly roll on the **Criminal

figures on the center of each of three random table edges. They are looking to
fight both sides, but will ignore Suspect markers.

one, the clock advances **1D6** ticks.
- When it reaches **10** , the law shows up: Place **6 Enforcers** on the center of a
table edge. They are looking to take down anyone they encounter, and will
remove any Suspect or City marker within **4”** of them. They will attempt to
move within **6”** of your crew before firing.
- A crew member may surrender to a law officer in sight of them. See “ **Messing

```
It could just be your imagination.
```
- In the nearest terrain feature to the character, place a **City marker** and a
    **Suspect marker**.

It’s a Complicated Situation
It is possible for events to occur more than
once, such as encountering reporters several
times or multiple gangs showing up (to fight
each other and you!). You gotta roll with the
punches when you go downtown!

## Scenarios & Settings


## Messing with the Law

```
If a character surrenders to the law, you can be
in one of three situations. If you have a current
Bounty Hunter or Vigilante Rival, you are at
least a Level 2 Perpetrator. If you have an
Enforcer Rival you are Level 3.
```
```
Level 1 Perpetrator
If nobody in your crew has attacked the
law officials in this scenario, the arrested
character can make a 1D6+Savvy roll with
a 6+ , meaning they talk their way out of
things. Failure means being detained for 1D6
campaign turns , with all their weapons other
than those with the Pistol trait confiscated
indefinitely.
```
```
Level 2 Perpetrator
A member of your crew has attacked the law
officials, but the surrendering character did
```
```
not. A Savvy test of 8+ is required. If you
fail, you are detained for 1D6+2 campaign
turns. In addition, all weapons are confiscated,
regardless of the outcome.
```
```
Level 3 Perpetrator
If the surrendering character fired on the law
officials, they are sent to a prison planet. They
cannot be used again in this campaign (see
New Campaigns boxout). While detained,
characters can take no actions or experience
any events. They recover from injuries normally.
```
## The End Game

```
You always have to move off the table to
complete a Street Fight scenario. You may
escape through any table edge. If a building
has interior access and extends off the table,
you can escape through the building interior
as well.
```
```
Payoffs
Holding the Field requires clearing all enemies
and Suspect markers. Typically, you are better
off just legging it. All post-game resolution is
handled normally as per the core rules.
```
## New Kit

```
When starting a new campaign, you may
include one character that was previously
sent to a prison planet. They bring with them
their old profile, but will have been stripped
of all equipment as well as Implants. They
also bring with them 3 Enforcer Rivals (!)
On the upside, you may add 1 Story Point ,
and they receive 3 XP for having survived
the ordeal.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


## Scenarios & Settings

**Salvage** jobs are a new type of mission,
based around exploring an area for possible
valuables, resembling a treasure hunt in
space. This game style tends to be more
deliberate and exploration-driven while still
presenting the chance for fierce gun battles.
This new job type can be added into an
ongoing campaign at any time.

Players should note that Salvage missions
are extremely random, and as such the
difficulty can vary tremendously from
between missions.

## Requirements

You will need markers to indicate the
following:

**Contacts:** Likely opposition during the
scenario. You will need around 10 of these.

**Salvage:** Valuable scrap. 6 markers should
be plenty.

**Points of Interest:** Things you need to
investigate. You will need 6 of these.

## What is Salvage?

As defined by Unity law, if a ship is drifting
in space and lacking a crew, it can be
considered ‘salvage’. Properly licensed
salvage operators may board the ship and
strip it for valuables, provided all navigation
data-files are handed over to the relevant
authorities. In addition, the salvage team
must de-orbit or detonate the ship if it is
likely to provide a hazard.

```
Salvage teams typically also conduct more
conventional “treasure hunt” operations.
Crashed surface wrecks and abandoned
industrial facilities are home to interesting
scraps of tech to those without qualms
about stepping over a few shriveled corpses
in the process.
```
## Finding a Salvage Job

```
Looking for a salvage job requires a crew
action in the campaign turn. Roll 1D6 , and
consult the table below:
```
```
1D6 ROLL SALVAGE OPTION
1 No job
2-3 Fee
4-5 Salvage job
6 Illegal job
```
## Using Salvage with other rules

```
The Enemy Deployment Variables (p.44)
and Escalating Battles (p.46) cannot be used.
AI Variations (p.42) and Elite-level Enemies
(p.48) can be used normally.
```
## Space requirements:

```
Salvage missions can become cramped
on a 2x2 table. 3x3 feet is recommended,
and if this is not an option, consider
reducing all movement distances by 1”.
```
# S A LVAG E

# JOBS


## Scenarios & Settings

```
No job means no salvage is available this
campaign turn.
Fee means you must pay a 2 Credit
(non-refundable) fee to accept the job.
Salvage job means a job is available.
Illegal job means an illegal job is available
this campaign turn.
You do not have to decide immediately if you
will take the job. You can wait until you have
finished your campaign actions as usual,
before deciding.
Rival attacks can still attack you, as usual. Any
job offered is only available this campaign
turn. If you skip it, or are prevented by Rivals,
the chance is lost.
```
## Illegal Jobs

```
Carrying out an illegal job means a chance of
getting in trouble with the law.
When rolling for post-game Rivals, roll 1D6 :
On a 1-4 , you got away with it.
On a 5-6 , the authorities are on your trail, and
you must do ONE of the following:
```
_- Pay a fine equal to the die roll in Credits.
- Hand over all Salvage units obtained_
    _during the job.
- Add an Enforcer Rival._


## Setting Up to Play Your Mission

The normal **_Deployment Conditions_** and
**_Notable Sights tables_** (core rulebook, pp.88-
89) are not used.

Do not roll for a mission objective.

The table can be set up using interior floor
plans, but could also take place in a ruined
colony, wrecked industrial site, or abandoned
cave complex that used to be inhabited by
something. If using floor plans, make sure
there are exits towards each battlefield edge.

Place Salvage Markers:
Place **1D3+1 Salvage markers** around the
table, spread as evenly as possible. These
represent valuable bits of electronics, mineral
deposits, or other interesting snippets.

Any crew member can pick up Salvage simply
by moving into contact with the marker. When
they do so, set the marker aside: the crew has
gained **1 Salvage unit**. A Salvage unit does
not have to be carried around by a specific
character, and cannot be lost during the game.

Place Points of Interest:
Place **1 Point of Interest marker** close to
the center of each battlefield quarter. These
represent areas that showed up on your ship
scanners as being potentially interesting.
You will need to **investigate all four** to
complete the mission.

```
Deployment:
Randomly select a battlefield edge. Split your
crew into two groups that are as equal in size
as possible. Each group is placed anywhere
you like along the selected edge, provided:
```
_- All figures are within_ **_2” of the battlefield_**
    **_edge_**_.
- There is_ **_at least 10” between the two_**
    **_groups_**_._
You are now ready to start playing. Note that
you do not yet know what opposition you will
be up against (or even if any opposition is
present at all).
There is no roll to _Seize the Initiative_.

```
Playing the Game
You must reveal all four Points of Interest,
dealing with any problems you encounter
en route.
```
## The Tension Track

```
Advancing through an old ruin or a dead ship
is unpleasant stuff: Anything could be lurking
just out of sight, and the environment itself
plays on the nerves, making the crew imagine
threats behind every corner.
As you play, you will track the level of Tension ,
a measure of how likely you are to encounter
difficulties.
At the end of the first round, Tension is set
equal to half the crew size, rounded up. Keep
a die at next to the battlefield area or use a
piece of scrap paper to keep track. The higher
the Tension level is, the larger the chance of
encountering something.
At the beginning of each round, roll 1D6 :
```
_- If the roll is above the Tension score,_ **_raise_**
    **_Tension_** _by_ **_+1_**_.
- If the roll is equal to or below Tension,_
    **_reduce Tension by the number on the_**
    **_D6 die roll_** _, and a_ **_Contact_** _is spawned;_
    _see below._

## The Exploration Round

```
If any Contacts or enemies are present,
you will play a normal battle round. If
there are no contacts or enemy figures
on the board, the round is always
considered an Exploration Round.
During Exploration rounds, a reaction
roll is not made at the start of the round.
Instead, your crew may move in any
order you like. Crew cannot Dash or use
equipment during Exploration rounds.
```
## Scenarios & Settings


## Contacts

```
Contacts represent a high probability of
enemy presence, such as scanner fluctuations,
the sound of equipment, voices echoing
down spaceship hallways, and so forth. When
a Contact is spawned, a Contact marker is
placed according to the following rules:
```
_- Randomly select a crew member.
- Place a_ **Contact marker** _at the closest_
    _point to the selected crew member that_
    _is_ not _within_ **_6”_** _or line of sight of any_
    _crew member._
       _- If multiple locations are equally suitable,_
          _place the marker at the location that would_
          _be closest to a_ **_Point of Interest_**_._
       _- Contacts markers are revealed and resolved_
          _if, at any point, they are either:_
       _-_ **_Within 6”_** _and_ **_Line of Sight_** _of a crew_
          _member, or_
       _-_ **_Within 3”_** _of a crew member._
       When either condition occurs, roll **1D6** on the
       table below:

```
D6 R E S U LT CONTACT EFFECT
1 “Beep, sir?” It was nothing after all.
Remove the Contact marker.
2 “Are you reading it
right?”
```
```
Select a crew member who opines they have
a bad feeling about this.
Remove the Contact marker and modify Tension by +1.
3-5 “Hostiles!” You have encountered hostile forces.
Proceed to the Hostiles! section below.
6 “We’ve got movement
all over the place!”
```
```
The scanner is going haywire.
Remove the Contact marker , then spawn 2 new Contact
markers near the crew member that triggered this result,
as per the normal placement rules.
```
## Hostiles!

```
If you encounter Hostiles for the first time,
roll D100 to see what type of enemy you
will be fighting in this mission, then check
on the enemy table indicated by the result’s
description to determine the enemy type.
```
```
Whoever the enemy is, they will not be
accompanied by any Unique Individuals.
As you play the mission you will need to track
how many times you roll each Hostiles! result.
Mark this next to the Tension track.

66-100 Infestation This is the worst type of job. Determine a random opponent type from
the Roving Threats table (core rulebook, p.101). Modify Tension by +6.

Consult the table below to determine how

```
Enemies should be placed in positions of
Cover (if possible) on or within 1” of the
marker.
Newly placed enemies cannot act during the
round in which they are placed.
```
## Enemy Actions Phase Scanner Check

```
Contact markers that were already on the table
at the start of the round will move during the
Enemy Actions phase. This happens after all
enemy forces have acted.
To move a Contact marker, roll two D6 in
separate colors (or one at a time). The darker
```

```
color represents Aggression. If this roll is
highest, the marker moves this many inches
towards the nearest crew figure.
The lighter color represents Chance. If this roll
is highest, the marker moves this many inches
in a random direction. If the dice are equal,
the marker remains in place.
Contacts will move around terrain as required.
They will halt the move if they would cross the
battlefield edge.
If a moving marker would be detected, roll
to resolve it immediately. The enemy forces
cannot take any actions during the round
when this happens.
```
## Points of Interest

```
Points of Interest are investigated
automatically when a character comes within
3” and Line of Sight of the marker. Roll D100
on the table below, then remove the Point of
Interest marker from the game.

Experience points are awarded normally.
To win the mission, you must have resolved

Salvage

```
Scrapper: a merchant that trades in junk,
salvage, and broken parts.
```
_- Unity agent guide to Fringe spacer slang._

In Post-battle Step 4. Get paid (core rulebook,
p.120), tally up how many units of **Salvage**
you have obtained.

To determine what the Scrappers are willing
to offer for your **Salvage** , carry out the
following process:

Roll **three times** on the **Loot** table (core
rulebook, p.131).

For each result, roll **1D6** to determine how
many units of Salvage you had to trade in.
Treat a roll of a **1** as a **2**. You may obtain any of
the items you can afford. Note that you _cannot_
convert Credits to Salvage units.

You can visit the Scrappers once per campaign
turn, and may opt to hang on to Salvage units
if you don’t find anything that interests you.

Invasion checks and Salvage
There are no Invasion checks after a
Salvage battle.

## It’s just scrap metal, right?

```
When purchasing any of the following,
you may cash in Salvage to offset the
cost in Credits. 1 unit of Salvage equals
1 Credit ONLY when purchasing:
```
_- Ship repairs
- Ship modules
- Bot upgrades_

## DIFFICULTY TOGGLES

```
If you are using Elite-level enemies in
the campaign, they can be used in a
Salvage mission as well.
If you want to make the game easier,
start all missions at Tension 0.
If you want to make the game harder,
add +1 Tension every time a Contact
marker is removed from the battlefield
for any reason.

at his helmet. He never could get used to the

_“You appear to be in considerable distress”

_“Considerable.” Mack coughed, and
threw the helmet on their pile of salvage.
The mechanical being studied him before its
communications indicator blinked again._

_“Is your life support module still functional?”
Mack looked down. A thick, blue liquid
slowly dripped from his belt pack._

_“No, it took an energy blast right to the
battery. I don’t think there’s....” He paused_

```

its customary lack of emotion. “Or do you

“Yes.”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Temporary disability is all.
Like when you swallow something too fast.”
“I have no concept of that experience.” The
Soulless ejected the depleted power cell from
its hyperblaster and clipped the weapon into

## Scenarios & Settings

```
Fringe space is a confusing, chaotic, and often
violent place. While some worlds – especially
those patrolled by Unity naval forces – exist in
relative peace and quiet for prolonged periods
of time, the sort of places a freelancer crew
visits are frequently less stable.
Use the following rules to make the Fringe
feel more anarchic and wild as you travel
deeper into uncontrolled space. This may not
be suitable for every campaign, so you may
opt to use it for some systems you visit and
not for others.
If using this system, when arriving on a new
world, roll 1D6.
A roll of 4+ indicates the world is Unstable.
You may opt to use a 5+ roll if you prefer a
less chaotic environment.
```
## Instability

```
An Unstable world always maintains an
Instability score which is tracked by the
player. When you arrive on the world, it begins
at +1 Instability.
During the Invasion step of every campaign
turn, add 1D6 to the total.
Adjust the total by an additional +1 for every
active Rival on this world.
Subtract -1 if you completed a Patron job this
campaign turn.
Subtract -1 if you Held the Field against a
Roving Threat this campaign turn.
If this causes Instability to reach or exceed 10 ,
make a D100 roll on the table below, reduce
the Instability score by the amount listed, and
apply the listed effect:

Instead of taking another job, you can go after the
gang at any time. No roll is required to find them.

campaign turn. Set up a Fight Off mission (core rules,
p.90). The enemy squad has a +1 Combat Skill and
includes 1 additional Specialist.
Until the squad has been destroyed, you must check

two sides struggling for control. You may side
with either of them at your choice, but once chosen,
you cannot switch sides.
Each mission will be an Opportunity Mission against
the opposing force. Add 2 additional regular enemies
and 1 additional Specialist to the enemy force
(for a total of 3 additional figures).
You receive +1 Credit for each such mission undertaken.
During the Check for Galactic War Progress step,
roll on the table normally (core rules, p.126). A result
of “Unity Victorious” indicates your faction has won
the war. You receive 1D6 Credits in bonus pay (not to
exceed the number of missions you have done) and
due to your war-hero status, you may immediately
remove 1 random Rival from your list.
A result of “Lost to Unity” indicates your side lost.
You must immediately try to leave next campaign turn,
similar to if the world had fallen to invasion. If you are
unable to leave, your ship and all Credits are confiscated
before you are booted off-world on a shuttle.
You may leave at any time before the war is over
(i.e. you are not conscripted into service)
```
Any result of “NA” means Instability is no longer tracked: The world has bigger problems to
worry about!


## Scenarios & Settings

```
The core mechanics for ship loans were
designed to be simple and unintrusive.
However, if you seek a more in-depth
roleplaying experience, this section offers
expanded details about whose money is really
paying for your ship. This does mean more
things to track, but gives your ship loan more
narrative bite.
These rule options are best added when
starting a new campaign, in which case work
through the process below when creating
your ship.
```
```
If you have to obtain a ship in-game (either
because you opted to use the Trailmaker’s
Tookit option to begin without a ship, or
because your ship has been destroyed), you
may work through this process once per
campaign turn to determine what kind of offer
is available to you.

of the core rules. Whether during character
creation or a loan taken during play, the
following adjustments are made:
```

Each loan will have two thresholds as shown

Collectors
An intergalactic collection agency is now
on your tail. Every campaign turn during
‘ **Step 1. Upkeep and Ship repairs** ’ you must
roll **1D6+1** :

If the roll is **equal to or below** the number
of campaign turns you have spent on the
current world, they catch up with you, and you
are assessed a fine of **3D6 Credits**. If you are
unable to pay the fine in full immediately,
it is added to your loan, and you must
add a **Bounty Hunter Rival** to your roster
immediately. Either way, you may then delete
the Collectors from your list of problems.

Note that you can have multiple Collectors
chasing you at the same time, with multiple
potential fines.

```
Collectors, Fringe-style
An intergalactic collection agency is on your
tail... and they have guns. Add a Rival to your
list as per “Collection Squads”, below.
Each time this result is obtained, another
squad is added to your Rivals list. They
are treated as a normal Rival for all rules
purposes. As they are often “free contractors”
they will not stop hunting you, even if you
do catch up on your payments. They must be
dealt with like any other Rival. If they chase
you down, you may pay them 10 Credits to
get them off your back and remove them from
your roster.

turn, when assessing ship interest roll
2D6. On a 2-5 , your ship is seized by local
authorities until it can be paid back to below
Threshold 1. Interest will still accrue while the
ship is impounded, unless the loan originator
is Unity or a Sector Government.
Note down the amount of debt owed when
the ship is seized. You must decrease your
outstanding loan value to 10 Credits below

the amount owed at the time of seizure
to get your ship back or cancel the
outstanding warrant.
Rolling this status multiple times increases
the seizure range by 1 each time ( 2-6 , 2-7 ,
and so on).
```
```
Permanent Seizure
A warrant is out for your ship and they mean
business. Every campaign turn, roll 2D6. On a
2-6 , your ship is seized permanently by local
authorities, and permanently lost.
You can cancel the warrant by decrease your
outstanding loan value to 10 Credits below the
amount owed when the warrant was issued.
Rolling this status multiple times increases
the seizure range by 1 each time ( 2-6 , 2-7 ,
and so on).

Collection Squads
Any Rivals obtained due to loans will be of
the type listed in the table above. Unlike
regular Rivals, they will always follow you from
world to world, though they can be fought off
as normal.
```
## Fight it out:

```
When someone comes to seize your ship, you
can choose to fight it out:
Set up a battle against Enforcers (core rules,
p.96), adding +2 basic enemies to their
number.
Set up in the center of the table, at least 12”
from a table edge. The enemy arrives from two
randomly selected battlefield edges, with their
forces split evenly between the two edges.
Then randomly determine which table edge
you must escape across.
If at least one crew member escapes the
battle, you can leave off-world. The warrant
remains in place, and an Enforcer Rival is
added to your roster.
```

If you are a little stuck for inspiration or you
enjoy seeing what the dice come up with,
you can use the tables below to generate a
few quick names. Simply roll **D100** on each

## CONTENTS


**Introduction**

```
In Bug Hunt – a variant of Five Parsecs
from Home – you take charge of a “Hunter
Squad” tasked with going into deep-space
wrecks, abandoned colonies, or decrepit space
stations to clear out any hostile alien lifeforms
found there.
This is not honorable combat against a foe that
believes in self-preservation or a negotiated
truce – it’s brutal, dirty fighting at close
quarters, lasting until the last lifeform crawls
from the battle site.
As you play, your characters will gain in
experience and reputation, hopefully earning
promotions and commendations... or at least
five days of R&R all paid for.
Bug Hunt is a standalone game, but allows
characters to be transferred to (or from)
```
```
Five Parsecs from Home , allowing you to
pursue an expanded game universe.
```
## Adventure Wargaming

```
Like Five Parsecs from Home , Bug Hunt  is
an adventure wargame. Instead of faceless
battles between generic armies, it follows a
personal story that unfolds as you play. You
will take your troopers up against the alien
hordes over multiple battles, establishing an
ongoing narrative as you do so.
Whereas  Five Parsecs from Home put you in
the roles of a ragtag band of adventurers, this
time you have friends: Well-trained soldiers
that take the field with you and will fight
(and die!) to help accomplish your mission.
However, the core of your experience is your
```
## Introduction


trio of troopers. Will they make it through their
tour of duty, or will they perish on some rock? 

The game differs from a normal wargame in a
number of ways.

The game assumes that a campaign is being
played, with each game informing the next.
Gaining experience and reputation will
determine your chances of future success. This
is especially notable if you bring characters
over from  **_Five Parsecs from Home_** , or muster
out to go adventuring after completing your
military career.

The results during a campaign suggest their
own interpretations and story ideas as patterns
emerge. Was your team’s Intel screwed up and
did you get swarmed with monsters twice in
a row? That’s probably an incompetent officer
somewhere in the chain of command. Maybe
you should name them?

```
The game is open ended. The military has its
own criteria for success, but you must weigh
the survival of your troopers versus the need
to achieve your goals. Are you cold enough
to sacrifice an entire fire team to take that
last objective? 
Although the game is written to be winnable,
balance is not built-in on a battle-by-battle
basis. Sometimes it is an easy ride. Sometimes
the aliens are wall-to-wall and it’s all you can
do to cling on. 
Whether you are entering Unified Space for
the first time, or you are an old hand, keep
your eyes peeled on that motion tracker.
```
## Introduction


## Conventions of the Game

```
Game Length
Bug Hunt is played in campaign turns. After
creating your hunter squad, each turn moves
through three stages.
First, any trooper not resting up in Sick Bay
can apply for special assignments in which
troopers can receive training that boosts
their abilities.
The squad then undertakes a mission
together, with a miniature-based tabletop
battle at its heart. Missions proceed in rounds ,
each round representing a few minutes of
activity or only a few moments of time during
battle. Each round ends when every figure on
each side has had a chance to do something.
Finally, a post-battle stage resolves long-
term consequences such as injuries and
deaths, and hands out Experience Point
rewards to the trooper, and Reputation
rewards to the squad itself.
A campaign goes on for as many turns as
you like. You can play a single mission or a
series of connected missions, while some
players prefer to follow a single personal
character, ending the campaign only if the
character dies. Others decide on a set number
of campaign turns, or just play until they feel
their squad’s story has been told.
The game needn’t be played solo. If you’d
like to play with a friend or two, simply split
the crew between you, and work together to
overcome the challenges of the universe.
```
```
Game Scale
We typically refer to an individual model in
the game as a figure or character. Figures
belonging to the human side are usually
referred to in the rules as troopers , while
the opposing side are known as enemies
(or sometimes from the human perspective
as “ aliens ”).
```
```
Any ability score bonuses or modifiers are
based on the figure in question.
Each miniature figure represents a single
character in the game world. You can use any
scale of figures you enjoy, though you will
need to identify individual troopers.
The game rules are written to work well
with both 15mm and 28mm figures. As the
distances that feel satisfying in 15mm games
also tend to match typical distances used in
28mm games, this means no adjustments
are typically required. Players using
particularly small-scale figures should adjust
some distances, especially with regards to
climbing. Counting all distances given in
inches as centimeters instead works great for
smaller figures.
All measurements in Bug Hunt are given in
inches. Players using 15mm scale miniatures
may prefer to read all measurements as
centimeters. If so, weapon ranges will still
look better in inches, but movement can feel
a bit quick.
All figures should be based individually, so
each figure can move on its own. This is typical
for science fiction games, but may present a
challenge for fans of very small figure ranges
(such as 6mm miniatures, which have a long
sci-fi association).
```
```
Dice Basics
Bug Hunt uses common six-sided dice (“ D6 ”),
but also the less common dice such as a ten-
sided die (“ D10 ”) or twelve-sided die (“ D12 ”),
available from many hobby shops and game
retailers, whether individually, or as part of a
polyhedral set.
When referring to rolling multiple dice
together, the number of dice is given before
the type of dice, so that “ 2D6 ” means rolling
two six-sided dice and “ 2D10 ” means rolling
two ten-sided dice. Unless otherwise stated,
you would add the result of the two dice
together, although this game also includes
```
## Introduction


occasions where multiple dice are rolled
together to produce multiple, distinct results;
such circumstances may be indicated by terms
such as “ **two D6** ” rather than “ **2D6** ”.

Sometimes, you will be asked for a modified
roll, adding or subtracting a number to the
dice roll for the final result. For example, if you
see “ **2D6+2** ”, this means roll two six-sided
dice, add them together, and then add 2 for
the result. A roll may also ask for a roll to be
adjusted by the ability score of a character; for
example, **2D6+Combat Skill**.

Additionally, you may be asked to roll “ **D100** ”.
Unless you are fortunate enough to have a
one-hundred-sided die, this means rolling
the **D10** twice, the first result for ‘tens’ and
the second for ‘units’, to generate a number
between 1 (01) and 100 (00). So, a result of **5**
then **8** would be **58**.

Rerolls and Natural Rolls
“Rerolling” always means picking up the
die or dice and rolling again, ignoring the
original result.

If a rule refers to the _natural_ result of a die roll,
it means the number shown on the die before
applying any modifiers. For example, a roll of
a **2** with a **+2 modifier** is a “ **natural 2** ” with a
final score of a **4**.

Random Direction Rolls
The game occasionally requires finding a
random direction. You can purchase various
“direction dice”, but a simple solution is to roll
a **D10** and use the raised tip as the direction.

## Norms of the Game

```
The rules assume player-controlled
characters facing opponents controlled
by the game system (the “enemy”). The
actions an enemy may take are defined and
described on page 198.
If the rules say you “may” do something, you
can choose not to. If the rules say you “must”
or “will” do something, you are required to
do so.
By default, the game rules assume the player
will pre-measure distances as they play. You
may opt to commit to a move or shot before
measuring, if you prefer. In multi-player
games, all players should agree before the
campaign begins.
```
```
Game Currencies
During gameplay you will be tracking a
number of different factors. The primary
ones are:
Experience Points ( XP ) – These are earned
by particular characters and measure their
progress as they learn (if they survive!)
Reputation – This is a general measure of how
famous you are and how much influence you
have with the troops around you.
Missions completed – This is tracked for each
character and is used to determine how much
time they have left in their career.
```
```
Essential Miniatures
If you are an experienced science fiction
gamer, you may already have a collection of
miniatures and terrain ready to go. If you’re
new to this, it may be overwhelming to get
started, especially in terms of miniatures.
These rules assume you are playing with
miniatures, but paper figures are gaining
popularity, and are very accessible.
You will need a collection of suitable trooper
figures. It is common to recycle figures when
a character leaves or dies, so 6-7 character
```
```
0
```
```
8
```
```
7 4
```
```
3
```
## Introduction


```
figures will do you fine to start with. Over time,
a collection of 10-15 suitable figures will give
you some options to pick from.
You will need to be able to tell your figures
apart, and the easier this is, the better. If you
use figures from the same set, such as the
many futuristic military miniature ranges
available, try to use distinctive poses or vary
the paint designs.
Your figures should reflect roughly the type
of weapons they are armed with, but as gear
changes frequently, it is not reasonable to
try and convert the figure’s weapons every
time you get a new item... especially since
characters can die rather easily!
For the opposition, the more and stranger
figures you have, the better.
For the opposition forces you will need critters.
There are a number of different enemy types,
some of which are very weird! To get you
started you will want a good collection of
“bugs”. These can be humanoid, giant insects
or anything similar. 15 figures is a good start
but on a bad mission they can add up fast,
so you can’t have too many. If you are on a
budget, don’t be afraid to pick up some plastic
```
```
insects or lizards from the local toy store.
They are often perfectly sized for wargaming
and will cost you very little. They can even be
touched up with paint to look like suitable
space monsters.
It is common to “proxy” in a figure when you
realize you need something that you don’t
have. This means using a different figure to
stand in.
As long as you can play the game, you are
doing fine. You can easily start with just a
few figures and then expand as you go,
watching your collection expand as you
progress in the campaign.
```
## Main Characters and Grunts

```
The characters you follow in the campaign
game are the main characters. They earn
Experience Points as the campaign goes on,
and you determine their fates and stories. 
As you play battles, your main characters
will be accompanied by supporting troops.
These are not permanent characters, but
are only with you for the purpose of that
mission. These are only temporary characters
in the story, and are referred to as grunts
```
## Introduction


(sometimes out loud, which may explain why
they don’t stick around!)

## Ability Scores

Each of your characters is rated in five ability
scores, which you can record on a sheet of
paper, or on the Crew Log at the back of
these rules:

_-_ **_Reactions_** _is used to determine when a_
    _character can act during the turn.
-_ **_Speed_** _is straightforward: How far you can_
    _move in tabletop inches.
-_ **_Combat Skill_** _is added to all attack dice_
    _rolls.
-_ **_Toughness_** _is the number that enemies_
    _need to roll above to damage you.
-_ **_Savvy_** _is added to all Problem Solving_
    _dice rolls._

**Enemy** figures will not have **Reaction** and
**Savvy** scores.

## Weapon Ratings

Weapons are rated in three ways:

_-_ **_Range_** _is the maximum attack range given_
    _in tabletop inches.
-_ **_Shots_** _is the number of_ **_attack dice_** _you get_
    _to roll.
-_ **_Damage_** _is the number added to the_
    **_damage roll_**_._

Weapons may have additional traits granting
special rules, abilities, or exceptions.

For more on weapons, see page 179.

## The Mission Structure

During a **_Bug Hunt_** campaign, you follow
a few main characters (typically 3 or 4)
between missions.

```
When assigned a mission, your main
characters are supported by combat teams of
trained troopers. These always count as grunts,
and are only along for a single mission.
During the mission, you attempt to
accomplish military objectives while avoiding
or defeating enemy forces you encounter.
These enemies initially take the form of
Contact markers , representing scanner blips.
Note that there is no inherent limit to the
number of foes you might face.
If you stick around too long, you may well
get overrun.
Around the battlefield, you will also come
across Tactical Locations that may be of help:
Computer consoles allowing you to close
down access tunnels, maps allowing faster
access, colonial defense systems, and so forth.
```
```
In space, nobody can hear your attack dice
Being a procedurally generated game, there
is no guarantee that a given mission will be
tightly balanced and, given the nature of
the genre, this is viewed as a strength rather
than a flaw.
Difficulty settings are provided in the
Mission Set-up rules, if you wish to tailor the
experience.
```
## Special Thanks

```
A big thank you to everyone who helped
out, contributed, or provided feedback over
the years.
This game is heavily inspired by the Space
Crusade board game, the novels Armor and
Forever War , the UFO / XCOM computer
games and films like Screamers and Aliens
(of course).

## Introduction


```
In Bug Hunt , the player’s characters operate
as part of a squad that includes main
characters and grunts. This chapter will walk
you through the process of creating the
characters that you will be following in the
campaign game.
```
## Main Characters

```
In a typical campaign, you follow three
main characters – the central characters of
your campaign, who carry over from game
to game, developing their skills along the
way. You could increase the number of main
characters to four or even five, if you wanted
to have a slightly easier game, or if you
wanted to play with a friend.
Each main character begins with the
following profile:
```
```
REACTIONS 1
SPEED 4”
COMBAT SKILL +0
TOUGHNESS 3
SAVVY +0
```
```
To generate a backstory for each of your
main characters, use the three tables below
to generate their origin , basic training and
service history.
```
_- The_ **Effect** _column will note bonuses to_
    _your profile.
- The_ **Advantages** _column may provide_
    _bonus_ **Experience Points** _(meaning_
    _the character does not begin at_ **0 XP** _),_
    **Reputation** _, or_ **Completed Missions** _for_
    _the character. It is not assumed that your_
    _main characters begin as rookies.
-_ **Reputation** _gains are added to a single_
    _pool for the squad, rather than being_
    _tracked individually. The squad begins the_
    _campaign with a bit of rep already, and,_
    _as a squad’s reputation precedes it, this is_
    _unaffected by the occasional departure and_
    _replacement of individual members.
- Tally_ **Completed Missions** _for each_
    _individual character. These are not_
    _transferrable._
Note that the tables intentionally do
not depend on each other. Feel free to
concoct outrageous stories to explain
the particular combination of traits your
characters begin with.

```
```
Standard Equipment
Your characters will be given a standard
equipment load that they always carry.
Additional weaponry is issued on a per
mission basis (see page 187). This standard
load consists of:
```
_- Service Pistol
- Trooper armor (allowing a saving throw on_
    _a roll of 5+)_

## Character Creation


**Combat Teams**

On most missions, your main characters are
accompanied by grunts – additional support
troops not permanently attached to you in the
campaign. Think of them as the background
extras in a film. When deployed, grunts are
usually organized into **combat teams** of **2-4
troopers** which must obey the following rules.

A few grunts (e.g. the sniper) are elite enough
to form a one-figure combat team of. They do
not receive the **team formation** bonus below. 

Note: Combat Teams are only used for grunts,
never for your main characters. Your main
characters always move and fight individually.

Reactions
Treat each combat team as a single character
when rolling for Reactions, and every figure in
a given combat team acts in the same phase.

```
Example: If you have 2 main characters and
3 combat teams, you roll 5 dice for Reactions,
assigning one die to each combat team and
main character.
```
```
Team formation
These soldiers are highly trained professionals
(says the recruitment posters), able to operate
independently. However, they perform best
when deployed as a combat team.
If a combat team is in formation , they receive
a +1 bonus to their Reactions score.
At the start of each round, determine whether
combat teams are in formation: select a combat
team member, and if every other member of
that team is within 2” of the selected figure,
the team is in formation. The selected figure
can be changed each round as needs arise.
```
**Regiment Flavor table**

These random tables are here to provide
additional flavor and details for the regiment
your characters belong to. They do not affect
game play but are highly recommended.

```
If “[number]” is rolled, roll a D6 , then roll again
on the table. For example, a 74 = [number] ,
so I roll a D6. The result is 4. My next roll is 42
on column one, 17 on the column two. My
regiment is the 4th Renegade Wolves.

## TERRAIN GENERATION

```
This section helps define how different types
of terrain function in the game. Simply read
through this section and assign each of your
terrain pieces to the appropriate categories.
Feel free to create unusual or imaginative
terrain types for your specific gaming
situation, reflecting the unusual or unique
environments of alien worlds, unfamiliar
space stations, and mysterious structures.
```
```
Linear
Any wide feature that a miniature cannot
generally be placed on top of.
Examples: hedgerows, walls, sandbag
barricades, and similar.
```
```
Area
Features that cover a space on the table and
can have miniatures placed within them.
Area features may be designated as Difficult.
Examples: forest, bushes, and rubble.
```
```
Field
Similar to an Area feature, but ground level.
Field features may be designated as Difficult
or Impassable.
Examples: mud, water, or lava pools.
```
```
Individual
A single piece of terrain that a figure
cannot climb.
Examples: barrels, individual trees, and
sign posts.
```
```
Block
A terrain piece that can be climbed or
otherwise interacted with, but which figures
cannot enter.
Examples: boulders, sealed shipping
containers, or locked buildings.
```
```
Interior
An enclosed terrain piece that figures can
enter.
Examples: unsecured buildings, tunnels,
and caves.
```
## Line of Sight

```
When dealing with Block and Individual
features, use what is called “true Line of
Sight”: Lean down and see if the target is
visible from a model’s eye view. If a Line of
Sight is available, you need to determine if it
is stopped. Lines of Sight are stopped in the
following instances:
```
_-_ **3”** _after crossing the boundary of an_
    Area _feature_

# MAIN RULES

## Interaction with Terrain

```
Block and Linear features can be
climbed.
Area and Field features can be entered.
The Movement rules chapter discusses
how this influences movement (see
page 176).
```
## MAIN RULES


_-_ **3”** _after crossing a_ Linear _,_ Individual _or_
    Block _feature
-_ **3”** _into an_ Area _feature, even if the_
    _boundary was not crossed.
- If it crosses or is partially obscured by_
    _another figure_

**Note:** Ignore terrain features within **1”** of the
firer for the purposes of 1 and 2 above.

**_Example:_** _A figure within_ **1”** _of a wall could fire
across it with no restriction (as features within_
**1”** _are ignored). A figure several inches from
the wall could only fire across it, if the intended
target is within_ **3”** _of the crossing point._

Practically this means when fighting across
_Linear_ obstacles, either firer or target needs to
be within **3”** of the obstacle.

## Cover

```
A figure is considered to be in Cover for
combat purposes if any of the following
are true:
```
_- Line of Sight crossed any terrain feature
- Positioned within an_ Area _feature
- In contact with the corner of_ Block _terrain_
As we assume some mobility and survival
instinct on behalf of our characters, a figure
meeting these conditions is in Cover, even if
the miniature figure can otherwise be seen
completely clearly.

## MAIN RULES


**Movement**

```
When moving, a figure may move up to their
Speed in tabletop inches.
Opening doors costs 1” of movement.
Climbing through a window or hole costs 2”.
Figures moving on the ground cannot move
directly through another figure at any time.
```
```
Difficult terrain
Terrain features do not typically reduce
movement speed, but Difficult terrain will
consume an additional 1” of movement
allowance for every full 2” moved in it.
However, enemies are not affected by
Difficult terrain and move at full speed
through such features.
Difficult terrain includes forest, swamp, rubble,
and sand.
```
```
Combat teams
Figures in Combat Teams do not have to move
together. They may voluntarily break formation
and each figure may use different movement
options (such as Dashing, see below).
```
```
Dash
Characters that do not intend to fire can Dash ,
allowing them to move an additional 2”.
Enemies will Dash 3” but will Dash only if:
```
_- the additional movement will bring them_
    _in contact with a trooper,_
    _OR
- they are in the open and have Line of Sight_
    _to a trooper._

```
Brawling
If a figure moves into contact with an
opposing figure, they cease moving
immediately, and a Brawl must be resolved.
Troopers cannot enter a Brawl by Dashing,
while enemies can.
```
```
A trooper that enters a Brawl on their action
cannot fire a weapon, but a trooper that is
engaged in a Brawl before they have acted
could still fire normally.
See page 177 for rules on Brawling.
```
```
Moving up and down
Vertical obstacles can be traversed by
simply paying the cost in inches. For
example, crossing a 2” tall wall uses 2” of
movement allowance.
Figures cannot end a move part-way up a
surface or wall.
A descent equal to the height of the figure
or less can be performed for free. Any longer
drop requires the character to either climb
down or Jump.
Jumping does not require any available
movement, meaning a character can move to
an edge and jump down, but if the distance
exceeds the height of the figure their turn
comes to an end. Jumping down 3” or further
inflicts a Damage 0 hit. Troopers may not
jump down from a height exceeding 6”.
Characters can leap over a gap up to 2”
wide, counting it as part of their standard
movement.
```
## Enemy Movement

```
As noted above, Enemies can Dash 3” under
certain conditions, and are unaffected by
Difficult terrain. Additionally:
```
_- Enemy figures can leap over gaps up to_ **3”**
    _wide, simply counting the gap as normal_
    _movement.
- Enemy figures can drop down from any_
    _distance up to_ **8”** _without damage. If the_
    _drop is more than_ **3”** _, the enemy must halt_
    _movement for the round, otherwise it may_
    _continue moving after the drop._

## MAIN RULES


**Combat**

A trooper may fire any single weapon they are
carrying as a **Combat Action**.

Unless within **3”** of a visible opponent, you
may fire at any visible target.

If a figure intends to attack and has enemies
within **3”** , it must target an enemy within
that range.

When a figure uses a weapon with multiple
shots, they may resolve them one at a
time and, if the target is destroyed, select
another target within 3” of the original for
subsequent shots.

When firing, roll **D6** , adding the **Combat Skill**
of the firer. The target number to Hit is:

_- Within_ **6”** _and in the open_ **3+**
_- Within weapon range and in the open_ **5+**
_- Within weapon range and in cover_ **6+**

If the modified score is _equal to or above_ the
target number, the shot hits. Missed shots
have no effect.

Rapid Fire
Aliens tend to arrive in swarms that make
tempting targets. Every **natural 6** on the firing
dice allows an additional shot to be taken
against the same target or another figure
within **2”**. You may forego these extra shots,
for example if attempting to avoid the risk of a
malfunction.

Malfunctions
When firing, keep a note of how many
**natural 1** s are rolled, counting both the initial
firing dice and any _Rapid Fire_ dice gained.
Any weapon that rolls _two or more_ **natural 1** s
during a single round has **malfunctioned** ,
and is temporarily unusable.

Attempting to restore the weapon to use
requires spending a Combat Action, and
making a successful **1D6+Savvy check** ,
scoring **7+**.

```
Area Weapons
Weapons with the Area trait are not subject to
the Rapid Fire and Malfunction rules.
Instead, when firing an Area weapon, roll
a separately colored D6 at the same time.
If this die scores a 1 , the weapon is out of
ammunition, and cannot be used for the
remainder of the battle.
```
## Brawling

```
Characters in physical (base) contact with each
other will fight in a Brawl rather than firing.
To make an attack during Brawling, troopers
roll 1D6+Combat Skill.
Characters armed for close quarter fighting
receive a bonus on top of this:
```
_-_ **_+2_** _if carrying a_ **Melee** _weapon
-_ **_+1_** _if carrying a_ **Pistol**_._
Only one weapon bonus can be counted.
Enemies roll **1D6+Combat Skill** , with no
other modifiers.
_- The lower total suffers a_ **Hit**
    _(see Resolving Hits, p.178).
- On a draw, both characters take a Hit.
- If an enemy rolls a_ **natural 1** _, it takes a_
    _Hit. If it survives, it will then immediately_
    _roll again._

```
Brawling Damage
Resolve Hits using the highest Damage value
of any Melee or Pistol weapon carried.
Characters with no suitable weapon strike
with Damage 0.
Enemies strike with the Damage rating
indicated in their profile.
```
```
Moving after Brawling
A character that eliminates their opponent may
move 2” in any direction, but cannot enter a
```
## MAIN RULES


```
new Brawl. This move is taken immediately,
even during the opponents’ turn.
Enemies that win a Brawl must always move
directly towards the nearest visible opponent,
if any.
If no enemies are visible, they will move into
the position occupied by the defeated trooper.
```
## Resolving Hits

```
Saving throws
Some characters, including your troopers, have
armor or protective devices that grant a saving
throw. This is expressed as giving a save on
a particular dice range, such as 4-6, 5-6, etc.
When the figure is hit, roll 1D6 ; a result within
this range indicates that they shrug off the hit,
are not Stunned but are knocked back 1”.
```
```
Note that some attacks may ignore armor.
Unless the rules state this, all damaging Hits
on troopers receive a saving throw.
Some enemy types may also receive saving
throws, which work in the same manner.
If a character is hit and fails their saving throw
(if one is permitted), regardless of the source
of the hit, roll 1D6 and add the Damage
rating of the attack or event.
```
_- If the result_ **exceeds Toughness** _, the_
    _character becomes a casualty and is_
    _removed from play.
- If the result is_ **equal to Toughness** _,_
    _the character is knocked back_ **_1”_** _and_
    **Wounded**_.
- If the result is_ **below Toughness** _the_
    _character is knocked back_ **1”** _and_ **Stunned**_._

```
Wounded
A Wounded trooper is at a -1 penalty to
Brawling attack rolls, and can no longer make
Dash moves. The Wounded status remains for
the rest of the mission. If Wounded a second
time in the mission, the trooper is removed as
a casualty.
Wounded enemies fall to the ground, and can
no longer move. However, if a trooper moves
within 1” , place the enemy in contact with
them, and the enemy will immediately attack
them in Brawling combat. A second Wound
will kill the enemy.
```
```
Stunned
Each time a figure is Stunned , place a suitable
marker. When the figure is selected for
activation, it may move OR carry out an Action
(but not both), if it is a trooper. An enemy
must remain in place, unable to act. In both
cases, remove 1 Stun marker from the figure.
If they return to 0 Stun markers , they are no
longer Stunned.
If a figure accumulates 3 Stun markers , it is
knocked out and removed from play.
If a Stunned figure is engaged in a Brawl, they
will fight at a -1 penalty , but may remove
1 Stun marker if they survive the Brawl.
```
```
Trooper Armor
All figures noted as wearing trooper
armor receive a saving throw on 5-6.
```
## MAIN RULES


**Weapons and gear**

The following are typical weapons and gear
that your characters may find themselves
armed with.

```
WEAPON RANGE SHOTS DAMAGE NOTES
Service pistol 14” 1 0 Pistol
Hand cannon 8” 1 1 Pistol
Carbine 18” 1 0 –
Combat rifle 26” 1 0 –
Shot gun 12” 2 1 Focused
Sniper rifle 40” 1 1 Aimed
Light machine gun 36” 3 1 Heavy
Incinerator 8” 3 1 Focused, Area
Hyper blaster 24” 3 1 Overheat
Plasma rifle 20” 2 1 Focused, Piercing
Boarding sword Brawl – 0 Melee
Power claw Brawl – 1 Melee
Flash grenade 6” – – Stun
Frag grenade 6” 2 0 Area
Mounted launcher 18” – – Launcher
```
Weapons may have the following traits:

_-_ **_Pistols_** _grant_ **_+1_** _to_ **_Brawling_** _rolls.
-_ **_Focused_** _weapons must direct all shots_
    _against a single target.
-_ **_Aimed_** _weapons grant_ **_+1 Hit bonus_** _if the_
    _firer does not move.
-_ **_Heavy_** _weapons suffer_ **_-1 to hit_** _when_
    _moving.
-_ **_Area_** _weapons resolve their Shots against_
    _the target (which may be an empty point_
    _on the table). Then regardless of effects, roll_
    **_1D6_** _for every figure within_ **_2”_**_. On a_ **_4+_** _,_
    _they are hit.
-_ **_Melee_** _weapons grant_ **_+2_** _to_ **_Brawling_**
    _rolls._
       _-_ **_Stun_** _weapons will Stun any target within_
          **_2”_** _of the target point on a_ **_3+_** _roll. Roll_
          _for each._
       _-_ **_Launchers_** _may fire any grenade type_
          _carried up to the range indicated._
       _-_ **_Piercing_** _weapons ignore saving throws._
       _-_ **_Overheat_** _causes the weapon to_
          _malfunction if all three firing dice score_
          _the same number. If less than three_
          _firing dice are rolled, no chance of_
          _malfunction exists._
       Note that _Stun_ and _Area_ weapons are targeted
       at any point in sight, not against a specific
       target figure. The “Shots” on the weapons
       profile only applies to the initial target, if any.

## MAIN RULES


**Unusual Situations**

```
This section covers various unusual situations
that can occur during the game. In most cases
you can resolve such cases yourself, but if you
prefer a bit of guidance, we’re here to help.
```
```
Entering a Brawl with multiple opponents
In rare cases, it is possible for a moving
character to enter a Brawl with two opponents
at the same time, typically if they are very
close together. If so, select which opponent
you fight at random. Even if you win, expect
no moment to breath; as soon as you down
the first enemy, the second is on you: fight the
other opponent immediately, adding +1 to
their Combat Skill.
```
```
Crashing into things
Some rules can force a character to move or
be moved randomly. Random moves are not
reduced by Difficult terrain. If the character
moves into a Linear , Block , or Individual
terrain feature, the character ceases moving. If
more than 1” remained of the random move
distance, they become Stunned.
If an enemy and trooper are moved randomly
into contact with each other, a Brawl is
resolved immediately. Both combatants count
as having Combat Skill +0 , ignoring all
modifiers.
```
```
Equal distance
When determining opponent actions, you
may run into multiple options if locations
or targets are equal in value, distance, or
some other factor. If so, roll a D6 , with
1-3 representing one possibility and
4-6 representing the other.
```
```
Cover is made of people!
If a Line of Sight is partially obscured by
another trooper, you may NOT fire. Also,
troopers may not fire Area weapons in such
a way that the attack would threaten other
troopers.
If a desired target is partially obscured by
another enemy, you may abandon the shot in
favor of a different target or choose to fire at
the obscuring figure instead.
```
```
Timing questions
If you are not sure how to resolve a complex
situation where multiple things are
happening all at once, work through it one
step at a time, resolving each game mechanic
as it is invoked. Nordic Weasel games
generally run on the basis that things resolve
as they occur, with no “queuing up” or similar
systems, and Bug Hunt is no exception to this.
```
```
Positioning
For the purpose of resolving any game
mechanic, all figures are assumed to occupy
the exact position they are currently
occupying on the gaming table.
Figures are never abstracted to
be generally in an area or
“moving through” an area.
```
## MAIN RULES


**Movie Magic**

If you prefer a more cinematic game, you can
use the rules in this chapter. Each of the listed
options below can be employed **once** in your
campaign. We recommend that you write
them on index cards and tear the cards up as
you use them.

Each can be narrated in any manner that
fits the table and situation: For example, a
barricade might be raising an interior blast
door, or your troopers might us it to rig up a
laser fence.

Barricade
Use at the beginning or end of any round.

Place a barricade anywhere on the table. It
must be a straight line and no wider than
**3”**. The barricade becomes impassable to all
movement (troopers, enemies, and Contact
markers) for the rest of the battle.

Double-Up
Use when selecting a character to act.

The character receives an Incinerator and may
fire either that or their regular weapon during
any given battle round. The Incinerator is
immune to malfunction.

Escape
Use after a battle.

Any characters that moved across a
battlefield edge do not have to roll on the
Lost Marine table.

Evac
Use after failing a roll for evac during a
mission.

Evac automatically arrives next round with no
roll required.

```
Extra Support
Use when rolling up Support for the mission.
The first Support option you request does not
require a die roll.
```
```
Lucky Find
Use when selecting a character to act.
Select any weapon from the Weapons table
(see p.179) and give it to the active character
or an ally within 4”. The new weapon is
not subject to malfunctions, but cannot be
retained after the mission.
```
```
Reinforcements
Use at the beginning or end of any round.
Select any one option from the mission
support list (see pp.188-9). The indicated
troops are placed at the center of any
battlefield edge of your choice, and will
participate in the battle normally.
No die roll is required for their arrival.
```
```
Remove Contact
Use at the beginning or end of any round.
Select a Contact marker anywhere on the table
and remove it from play.
```
```
Survived
Use after rolling for character injuries.
A character of your choice may ignore the
effects of an injury roll.
```
```
You want some too?
Use when selecting a character to act.
The selected trooper may move normally,
and then fire three times, with no chance of
weapon malfunction.
```
## MAIN RULES


```
Bug Hunt is played in a series of campaign
turns. Each of these may represent a few days,
a few weeks, or even several months. Think of
a campaign turn as an episode in a television
show, framing a particular story or adventure.
Each campaign turn you will be given a
mission , which is resolved on the gaming
table, as well as completing various other
activities beyond the battlefield.
```
```
To play a campaign turn, complete the
following stages in order:
```
1. **_Special Assignments_** _, below._
2. **_Fight a tabletop battle_** _(see_ **_Mission_**
    **_Generation_** _, page 184, then_ **_The Battle_**
    **_Round_** _, page 38)_**_._**
3. **_Post-battle_** _(see page 202)._

# CAMPAIGN

# TURN

## INTRODUCTORY CAMPAIGN


**Special Assignments**

Troopers do not spend all their time on
missions, but can spend valuable time honing
their skills in readiness. You may nominate any
of your characters for **Special Assignments** ,
unless they are in Sick Bay. Special
Assignments typically involve additional
training, but can also provide opportunities.

For each eligible character, select an
assignment, and roll **2D6** on the table below
to see whether they can obtain approval to
undertake it. Note that some assignments
have additional requirements that must be

```
met. Failure means you were not accepted
onto this (or any other) assignment this turn,
but you may try again in a future campaign
turn. A character can only complete a given
assignment once in their career.
For each Special Assignment undertaken, they
receive a training award and, where indicated
on the table, bonus XP and Reputation (“Rep.”).
In the unlikely event that a character has
successfully completed every possible
Assignment below, they spend this part of the
campaign turn playing cards in barracks.

```
Step 1. Set up battle area
The area you are going to play in can be set up
in any manner you like.
It is customary for bug hunting missions
to take place inside spaceships, colony
installations, and similar, and if you have
access to floor plans (such as modular tiles or
board game floors), you can utilize these for
such a battle. Players with 15mm scale figures
can easily take advantage of floor plans
intended for 25/28mm figures.
However, the enemy hordes certainly don’t
keep to building interiors, and missions can
take place in colonies, urban areas, or even
complete wilderness. A combat sweep through
a jungle can have a great movie atmosphere,
for example.
A typical (3x3 feet) battlefield should contain
10 decent-size terrain features , such as
large rocks, a collection of smaller crates, a
small structure, a forested area, or similar.
Distribute these fairly evenly, then add
5-10 small individual features (rocks,
crates, single trees, etc.) in any gaps.
Don’t be afraid to add some strange-looking
plants and rock formations: Aquarium
decorations are great for providing a fun alien
world feel.
```

## Mission Generation


Step 2. Determine and place Objectives
Place **6 dice** around the table, with numbers
1 through 6 showing. The dice should be
placed at locations that seem significant to
your gaming table, such as rooms, cross-roads,
raised ground, or similar. Space the dice
roughly evenly across your gaming table and
avoid placing them within **6”** of the battlefield
edges if at all possible.

Roll **three D6** and remove any of the table
dice that do not match one of the numbers
you rolled. The remaining dice become your
**Objectives**. You can replace these dice with
suitable markers or an identifiable piece of
scatter terrain to prevent it being accidentally
picked up during the game.

If two of the D6s rolled the same number,
the Objective with that number becomes a
**Vital Objective**. If all three rolled the same
number, the one remaining die becomes a
**Critical Objective**.

```
To determine the nature of each Objective,
roll a D6 on the table below. You may identify
a given Objective marker before rolling, or
determine the results first and assign the
results to the Objective markers where they
make the most sense.
During the mission, count how many
Objectives were completed. Vital Objectives
count as 2 when completed, while Critical
Objectives count as 3.
```
```
1D6 OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED WHEN
```
```
1 Patrol
At the end of each battle round, if a trooper is within 6” , roll 1D6.
On a 4+ , the Objective becomes completed.
```
```
2 Scout
This Objective is completed at the end of the round during which
a trooper moved to make contact with the marker.
```
```
3 Secure
This Objective is completed if at the end of a round, a trooper is
within 6” and no enemies are within 6”.
```
```
4 Retrieve
```
```
A trooper moving into contact and spending a Combat Action can pick up
the package. If the figure becomes a casualty, the package is dropped.
To complete the Objective, you must hold the package when Evac’ing.
```
```
5 Beacon
Move a trooper into contact with the marker to complete this Objective, once
all Hack, Secure, and Scout Objectives have been completed.
```
```
6 Hack
A trooper must move into contact and spend a Combat Action.
Roll 1D6+Savvy and score a 6+ to complete the Objective.
```
## Vital and Critical Objectives

```
Objectives are all important (according to the
colonel), but some are more important to the
overall war efforts. Objectives may be rated
as Vital or even Critical if they are especially
valuable. This will affect your success rate in
the mission, so think carefully before giving
up on one.
```
## Mission generation


```
Step 3. Select mission difficulty
You may select one of five difficulty settings
for the mission. Note that these do not affect
character progression but may be used to
```
```
regulate the brutality of the game experience.
This is useful when introducing the game to
new players, or if you want the struggle of
your life against impossible odds.

## Mission Generation


Step 4. Determine Priority
Not every mission is equally important to
those in authority. Sometimes it’s just a recon
sweep in a low-threat sector, sometimes it’s
the heart of the storm.

Roll **two D6s** , and pick the _lower_ result: This is
your **Priority Rating**. The higher it is, the more
resistance you will encounter, and the worse
things will be.

If a **Vital Objective** is on the table, **increase
Priority by +1**. If a **Critical Objective** is on
the table, **increase Priority by +2**.

If desired, you can call on your Reputation to
be assigned a higher or lower Priority mission.
You may spend up to 2 points of Reputation,
with each point raising or lowering the Priority
Rating by 1.

Regardless of points spent or modifiers,
Priority cannot be reduced below 1 or raised
above 6.

Step 5. Determine Spawn rating

The **Spawn Rating** adds to the inflow of
enemy reinforcements. It is equal to the
**Priority Rating minus 1** , but the final score
cannot exceed **3**.

**_Examples_** _: A Priority Rating of_ **_1_** _would result
in a Spawn Rating of_ **_0_** _, while a Priority Rating
of_ **_6_** _would result in a Spawn Rating of_ **_3_**_._

```
Step 6. Select loadout
Each main character may select to carry their
choice of Combat Rifle , Shotgun , or Boarding
Sword for the duration of the mission.
Additionally, one main character may opt to
swap the Service Pistol from their standard
equipment (see p.172) for a Hand Cannon for
the duration of the mission.
```
```
Step 7. Determine force strength
In addition to your main characters, you
always receive one Fire Team of soldiers
(grunts identical to the “ Fire Team ” Support
entry below).
You receive Support points equal to the
Priority of the mission.
Add +2 if you have selected the I’m too pretty
to die difficulty setting.
If desired, 1 point of Reputation may be
spent to gain +1 Support.
Each point grants one roll against a support
type of your choosing on the Support table
below. Roll 2D6 , with a result equal to or
above the target number granting you the
troops requested. A score below the target
means that type of Support is unavailable,
and the point is lost.
Each Support choice can only be requested
once before a particular mission, but you
may roll for each request and see if you get it,
before deciding what to roll for next.
```
```
Campaign escalation option (continued)
If using the Campaign escalation option
above, the Spawn Ratings would be:
0 – 0 – 1 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 3 – 3
```
```
Campaign escalation option
You may prefer to play a campaign that
slowly escalates in Priority. If so instead of
rolling, you will use the following Priority
Ratings in order as you play missions:
1 – 1 – 2 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6

## Mission generation


```
Step 8. Place Tactical Locations and
Initial Contacts
Tactical Locations:
You will need markers to indicate Tactical
Locations (see page 191) and Signals (if this
rule is used – see page 208), and they should
be readily distinct from the markers used for
Objectives.
If you are not using the Signals rule, 6 Tactical
Locations are placed on the battlefield.
If Signals are used, place 1D6 Signals , then
place Tactical Locations until the total number
of Signals and Tactical Locations adds up to 6.
For example, if placing 4 Signals, you would
then place 2 Tactical Locations.
Tactical Locations and Signals should be spread
as evenly as possible around the battlefield,
and if possible should be placed at least 2”
from any Objective markers. Signals must be
placed in or adjacent to a terrain feature.
```
```
Contacts:
Place a Contact marker on each Objective
(but not on Tactical Locations). Once this is
done, place one additional Contact marker
in the center of the table.
Add 1 extra Contact marker in the same
location if you have selected the Mega-
violence or Living nightmare difficulty settings.
Do not place this extra marker if you have
selected the I’m too pretty to die or Hey, not too
crazy difficulty settings. If you have opted for
Mess me up , no adjustments are made.
```
```
Step 9. Set up your troops
Your force is assumed to land by drop ship just
outside the battlefield. Randomly determine
one of the battlefield edges, and set up
anywhere on the battlefield within 3” of that
edge, with your forces as compact or spread
out along the edge as you like.
Any Objectives must be at least 12” from
your initial deployments. If they would be
closer, move them directly away towards
the opposite battlefield edge (Intel clearly
misjudged the terrain).
```
## Mission Generation


**Tactical Locations**

During the mission, you will encounter
**Tactical Locations**. These represent sites and
situations of potential value to your force:
Computer consoles, pathways that can be
sealed off, useful infrastructure, adaptable
equipment, and so forth. By investigating and
interacting with these locations, you can gain
an advantage against the alien hordes.

Tactical Locations are marked on the battlefield
with any suitable marker (we suggest a **0.5” x
0.5”** square).

## Investigating

```
To investigate a Tactical Location, a figure must
finish a move within 3” of the marker without
firing a weapon or engaging in a Brawl.
You can then roll on the following table to
determine the exact nature of the location.
Any figure that is within 3” and is not firing or
engaging in a Brawl (including the figure that
just investigated the Location) may attempt
to activate it. A further die roll is required
to activate and gain the tactical benefits, as
described below.
```
```
D6
```
```
TACTICAL
ADVANTAGE EFFECTS
```
```
1 Distract
```
```
When activated, all enemies within 18” are Distracted and cannot act
during the next Enemy Action phase. Note that Contact markers are
unaffected, but if a Contact marker is revealed within range, the newly
placed enemies will be affected immediately.
```
```
2-3 Block
```
```
The area within 2” of the marker becomes Impassable to Enemies or
Contact markers, but can be crossed without any hindrance by player
figures. At the end of each round including the current, roll a D6 : On a 6 ,
the area will become passable again at the end of the following round.
4-5 Neutralize Remove any one Contact marker of your choice.
```
```
6 Delay
```
```
For the rest of the current round and all of the two following rounds, no
new Contact markers can be added to the battlefield. Simply ignore any
rule that would require such a placement.
```
To activate the Tactical Location, roll
**1D6+Savvy** , scoring a **5+**. Mark the
location in some way if his roll fails. A second
failure to activate the same Location means
the functionality of the location has been
compromised in some way, and its Tactical
Advantage remains unavailable for the
remainder of the game.

```
Enemies and Tactical Locations
Until it has been activated, a Tactical Location
has no effect on enemy figures. They may
move over the marker, and will not factor
it into their decision making process at all.
Once it is activated, it has the normal effects
described in the table above.
```
## Mission generation


**Contacts**

```
Contact markers represent sounds,
footprints, and the shrill “bleep bleep” of the
team’s motion trackers as hostile lifeforms are
closing in.
You will need some sort of markers or tokens
to use as Contact markers during play. Board
game tokens can be adapted with ease, or you
may take any generic “alien” figure and paint
it in a pale grey.
While Contact markers are placed during the
Mission Generation rules (see p.184), their
function in the game is discussed below,
as they are principally connected to the
Movement rules.
```
## Moving Contact Markers

```
All Contact markers are moved during the
Enemy Action phase, but after all enemy
figures have moved. Begin with the Contact
marker nearest to a player figure (in absolute
terms, ignoring terrain, walls, and similar),
then the next nearest, etc.
To move a Contact marker, roll two D6 in
separate colors. The darker color represents
Aggression while the lighter color
represents Chance.
```
_- If the_ **_Chance_** _die is higher, move the_
    _marker that many inches in a random_
    _direction.
- If the_ **_Aggression_** _die is higher, move_
    _the marker that many inches towards the_
    _nearest player figure.
- If the dice are equal, the Contact marker_
    _remains in place, and a new Contact marker_
    _is placed on top of it. From the next round_
    _onwards, they will each move separately._

```
A Contact marker will move around or through
terrain features as required. Their movement
is never reduced due to difficult ground. If it
would move off the battlefield edge, it will halt
in place upon reaching the edge.
```
## Detecting Contact Markers

```
Check for Detection of Contact markers:
```
_- At the_ **_end_** _of each marker’s move (and only_
    _at the end, never during).
- Whenever a player figure_ **_finishes_** _the_
    _Movement portion of its action (checking_
    _all Contact markers for Detection).
- Immediately when a new Contact marker_
    _is placed. Surprise!_
Detection is based on proximity:
_- Markers_ **_in sight and not in cover_** _are_
    _Detected within_ **_6”_**_.
- Markers_ **_in cover_** _or_ **_out of sight_** _are_
    _Detected within_ **_3”_**_._
Note that Line of Sight is _not_ required to
Detect, as troops carry close range detection
devices (and in any event, most alien life
forms make scary hissing sounds).
Upon **Detection** , Immediately roll **1D6** on the
Contact table below. All results are applied
before continuing with the game. If a Marker
is Detected at the end of a player figure’s
move, they may then fire on any revealed
enemies, if possible. **Note that Contact
markers themselves cannot be fired upon.**

## Mission Generation


```

```
```
The marker is replaced with enemy figures.
All enemies encountered during a particular mission will be of the same
type. If you have not yet determined the type, roll on the table in the
Mission Generation chapter (see p.184). This table should also be used to
determine numbers.
If you have encountered this enemy type before in the campaign, determine
the variant you have encountered this time. See page 196.
If this is the third or later mission of the campaign, you will need to check
if a pack leader is present. See page 197.
Place all enemy figures within 1” of the marker. They do not perform any
actions this round.
```
## “Beep... Sir?”

At the start of each round from Round 2
onwards, roll **D6s** equal to the **Priority** of
the mission (from 1 to 6, typically 2-3; See
Determine Priority, page 187). If any of the
dice roll a **6** , place one new **Contact** marker
on the table by rolling a random direction
die in the center of the table. The marker
is placed at the point of a battlefield edge
indicated by the die.

Check for **Detection** after placing the marker.
If the marker is Detected, all figures within
**12”** may fire upon the revealed enemies
immediately as a bonus action. This bonus
shot does not prevent the figures from acting
normally during the round, and only applies
to markers placed under this rule.

```
They’re inside the perimeter!
On the Living Nightmare difficulty setting (see
page 26), place a Contact marker for each 6
rolled instead.
Example: My mission is Priority 3 and I roll
a 2 , 6 , 6 on the dice. I place one new Contact
marker at a random battlefield edge. If I was
playing on the Living Nightmare setting, I
would place two instead.
```
## Mission generation


**Enemy table**

```
When you first reveal a Contact marker
during a mission, roll on the table below to
determine the enemy type. This will also give
you the number encountered per Contact
marker and their profiles.
The enemy types have been left fairly vague
so that you can fit your own miniatures
collection to them as best as possible. Feel
free to invent your own backstory about what
these creatures are, and don’t feel too hung
up on the names if you have something in
your collection that would really fit a particular
monster profile.
The Converted , Horde , and Swarm enemies
originate in the Unified Space setting. The
Converted are corpses re-animated through
```
```
cybernetics for use as assault troops, the
Horde rely on genetic manipulation to create
monstrosities for war, and the Swarm are your
typical fast, homicidal alien creatures.
The Numbers column gives the dice roll to be
made whenever a Contact marker is revealed
as Enemies. Note that on the I’m too pretty to
die difficulty setting, the number is reduced
by 1. On the Mega-violence and Living
Nightmare difficulty settings, the number is
increased by 1.
The table gives the Speed, Combat Skill, and
Toughness of the enemies in the appropriate
columns. The Damage column is used when
enemies inflict a hit on a trooper.

## Mission generation


## Enemy Variants

```
If you have encountered a particular enemy
type previously in your campaign, all future
encounters will be with a variant strain. The
first time your team spots an enemy (not
```
```
just a Contact marker) during a mission, roll
D6 and consult the table below. All enemies
encountered during a mission will be the
same variant, and variant types are generated
new each mission.
```
```
D6 SUB -TYPE EFFECTS

Any enemy that ends a move within 6” and sight of a trooper will make a

(regardless of Combat Skill, Cover, or other factors). Hits are resolved with
Damage 1. Armor applies normally.
```
```
2 Ambushers
```
```
When a Contact marker is revealed, the figures are placed within or behind the
closest terrain feature within 4” of the marker, though they cannot be placed in
base contact with a trooper. If no location is possible, they deploy as normal.
```
```
3 Toughs
The enemies receive a 5+ saving throw against Area weapons. If they already
have an existing save, they are combined into a single 4+ saving throw.
4 Swarmers When each Contact is revealed, one additional enemy is placed on the table.
5 Runners Increase movement speed by +1”.
```
```
6 Screamers
```
```
These variants summon the rest of their kind.
At the end of each Enemy Action phase, roll D10. If it is equal to or below the
number of enemies currently on the table, one additional enemy is placed in
the exact center of the battlefield. It cannot act in the round it was placed.
```
## Mission Generation


## Pack Leaders

Unless this is one of the first two missions of
the campaign, there is a chance the enemies
revealed will be accompanied by a **pack leader**.

Roll **three D12**. If any of the dice roll equal
or below the number of enemies revealed by
the marker, a single pack leader is present.
**Discard one** of the **D12** s from the pool going
forward. This means that over the course of the
mission you can encounter a **maximum of
3 pack leaders** , each revealed by a different
Contact marker.

```
The Pack Leader should be represented by
either a different figure from the rest of the
pack, or be marked with a suitable token.
When first placed, the Pack Leader figure is
always placed furthest from any troopers.
For each pack leader, roll D6 on the table
below to see what special behaviour it exhibits
either in itself or its pack. Pack Leaders move
and fight normally, except as explained below.
```
```
D6 SUB -TYPE EFFECTS
```
```
1 Leader
```
```
Acting as a focus, the leader ensures the foe will target your positions.
When moving a Contact marker within 9” , a Chance die is not rolled, only an
Aggression die.
```
```
2 Lancer
```
```
Capable of launching a devastating attack at range.
At the end of each move, if a trooper is in Line of Sight of the enemy, the Lancer
will fire a dart at the nearest trooper visible. The dart hits on a D6 roll of 5+
(regardless of Combat Skill or cover), strikes with Damage 1 and ignores armor.
Lancers will always attempt to move to Cover where they can see troopers, and
will not enter close combat.
```
```
3 Caller
```
```
Emits a signal to the rest of the brood.
Each time the Caller is activated, roll 1D6. If the roll is higher than the number of
Contacts on the table, place a Contact adjacent to the Caller.
The Caller will attempt to move to the center of the table and then hide there.
```
```
4 Assassin
```
```
A particularly lethal and virulent foe.
Increase Damage and Combat Skill by 1.
All attacks from the Assassin ignores armor.
```
```
5 Bruiser
```
```
Especially large and tough.
Increase Toughness by 1. The enemy receives a 4+ saving throw against all
Hits, replacing its normal save (if any).
```
```
6 Driver
```
```
Through strange means it urges the foe forward.
All enemies that begin their activation within 6” of the Driver increase their
movement by +1” for the round.
```
## Mission generation


```
Each battle round consists of four phases:
```
1. **_Quick Action phase_**
2. **_Enemy Action phase_**
3. **_Slow Action phase_**
4. **_Spawn phase_**
To begin the round, roll a number of **D6** equal
to the number of your main characters and
combat teams. For example, if you have
**3 main character** and **4 combat teams** , you
would roll **7 dice**.
Assign each of the dice to one of your main
characters or Combat Teams. Each character or
team receives only a single die.
_- Any character or team assigned a die_ equal
    to or below _their_ **_Reaction_** _score will act in_
    _the_ **_Quick Action_** _phase.
- Any character or team assigned a die over_
    _their_ **_Reaction_** _score will act in the_ **_Slow_**
    **_Action_** _phase._
Note that regardless of the die rolls, all figures
will get to act each round: The Reaction rolls
determine what phase characters act in, not
whether or not they act at all.
All enemies will act in the **Enemy Action** phase.
The **Spawn** phase is used to determine new
arrivals, if the mission is using the Spawn
Points mechanic (see p.199).
The battle round ends when all figures on
both sides have acted.

## Actions

```
During a phase, player figures can act in any
order desired. Enemy figures act in order of
how far they are from player figures, starting
with the closest, then working back. As the
table can get quite busy, it is a good idea to
have some tokens, beads, or small dice to keep
track of who has already acted each round.
When acting, a figure may Move first, and
then perform a Combat Action such as firing
a weapon or fighting a Brawl. A figure may
forego either option but cannot perform them
in reverse order.
```
```
Stunned figures
If a trooper is Stunned , they may either Move
or perform a Combat Action, but cannot
attempt both. Stunned enemies will remain in
place and take no actions.
After the figure has acted, remove 1 Stun
marker from the figure.
Figures can accumulate multiple Stun markers.
```
```
Snap Fire
Troopers that are eligible to act in the Quick
Action phase may opt not to do so. This allows
them to either fire when an opponent moves
or to delay until the Slow Action phase.
If a targeted opponent is Stunned while taking
their movement, they lose the ability to take
any other actions this round. Firing during an
opponent’s move prevents the firing character
from moving this round.
```
# Battle

# ROUND

## Battle Round


Characters who opted to hold their Quick
Action for the opportunity of Snap Fire, but
who did not find an opportunity to fire in the
**Enemy Action** phase can _either_ Move _or_ Fire
in the **Slow Action** phase, but not both.

```
Enemies do not carry ranged weapons and will
not use this option.
```
**Spawn Points**

During a mission, your troopers may uncover
that the enemy is arriving from sectors beyond
this one. This may be through vents and ducts,
underground tunnels and more. **Spawn
Points** represent locations that the enemy is
using to converge on you.

As part of mission creation, the mission
creation system will dictate a **Spawn Rating**
which determines how many Spawn Points
will be revealed during that mission. If this
rating is 0, this rule is not used.

At the end of each round, proceed through the
following steps:

Step 1. Revealing Spawn Points
If there are unrevealed Spawn Points, a single
Spawn Point is now revealed and placed on
the battlefield. Make a random direction roll
in the center of the battlefield, and follow
the indicated direction to the edge of the
battlefield, placing the Spawn Point in the
indicated location.

**_Example:_** _If you have a Spawn Rating of_ **_2_** _, a
Spawn Point would be revealed at the ends of_
**_Rounds 1_** _and_ **_2_**_._

Step 2. Increment countdowns
This step will not apply in Round 1 of the
game.

Every Spawn Point that had a Countdown
marker placed in a previous round (see step 3,
below) _lowers_ the countdown value of that
marker by 1. If the score is reduced to **0,
remove the Countdown marker** and **place a
Contact marker** on the Spawn Point.

```
Step 3. Place countdowns
Roll a D6 for every Spawn Point that does not
have a Countdown marker by it (including any
Spawn Points that just produced a Contact
marker during Step 2).
```
_- On a_ **_1-4_** _, place a die with the indicated_
    _score next to the Spawn Point.
- On a_ **_5-6_** _, no die is placed this round, but_
    _the Spawn Point will be checked again next_
    _round._

## Closing Down Spawn Points

```
Troopers are trained to identify weak points in
defenses that could leave them open to attack.
A trooper may secure the location against
enemy incursions, whether by reprogramming
sentry guns, sealing bulkheads, laying mines
in the passageway, restarting the laser barrier
system, or similar means.
As long as a trooper is not firing their weapon,
and they are within 3” of a Spawn Point, they
may attempt to do so: Roll 1D6+Savvy , with a
6+ indicating success, in which case Remove
the Spawn Point and any Countdown marker
from play.
Only one trooper can work on a specific Spawn
Point at a time, but a single friendly trooper
within 1” of the worker may help, adding a
+1 bonus to the roll (but likewise cannot fire
while doing so).
```
## Battle Round


**Enemy Movement**

```
Enemy figures move according to more
simplified mechanics than troopers.
```
```
Order of movement
For determining the order of movement, start
with the enemy figure nearest to a player
figure (in absolute terms, ignoring terrain,
walls, and similar), then the next nearest,
etc. If two figures are equally distant, start on
the left side of the table and work your way
right. In most cases, the exact order of figure
movement won’t be an issue.
```
```
Movement direction
For determining the direction of movement,
the selected enemy moves at their full Speed
towards the nearest trooper (proximity
determined by the length of the path required
to reach them, this time factoring in any
obstacles that the enemy would have to move
around) in an attempt to engage them in
Brawling combat (see Brawling, page 177).
Due to superior, alien senses, they are aware of
the presence and position of every humanoid
in the area, despite remote locations or closed
doors. However, they ignore any trooper they
have no viable path towards, for example due
to Impassable terrain.
Enemies may move through each other. This
differs from troopers, who often wear bulky
armor and equipment, and do not move as
fluidly as aliens, who, in some cases, may be
used to swarming over one another.
```
```
Decision making
If multiple viable paths exist, enemies will opt
for the path that provides better protection from
ranged attacks without impeding movement
speed. However, enemies will not slow down
their advance specifically to take cover.
The enemy objective is always to enter
Brawling combat where possible.
```
```
Player vs player
When overseen by a human player, enemies
are not restricted to the normal “AI” rules in
this chapter, but may move as the player sees
fit. For example, they could skulk behind cover
instead of advancing recklessly.
Note that while Contact markers are not
troops, they must move at random, even with
a player controlling them.
```
```
Nowhere to run
There is no morale system in Bug Hunt : The
enemies don’t stop coming until you kill them
all. Whether they are part of a hive-mind that
cares little for the survival of individuals or
they are ravening space monsters, they will
attack until they are all destroyed.
Your troopers are in a desperate situation, and
while they may be nervous, their training will
keep them operating effectively. However,
when an operation goes haywire, it may be
time to make it out any which way you can.
Escaping from the mission area on foot is
extremely dangerous, but all troopers carry
beacons that can be used to locate them later
for pick up.
A trooper may remove themselves from
the rest of the battle by moving across any
battlefield edge. Afterwards, they must roll
on the Lost Marine table (see p.202) to
determine their fate. Escaping in this way
awards fewer Experience Points (although,
of course, a dead trooper receives no points
at all!)
```
```
A note on “nearness”
The method of calculating the nearness of
trooper and enemy differs between order of
movement and direction of movement. This is
a necessary tabletop practicality to reduce the
chance of the player moving a more distant
figure to a closer location and accidentally
moving them again later in the same round.
```
## Battle Round


**Ending the Mission**

Your goal is to complete as many of your
**Objectives** as possible. **Two or more** is
considered a **success** for the purposes of
awarding Experience Points after the battle.
A **Vital Objective** counts as **2** , while a
**Critical Objective** counts as **3**. Objectives are
discussed on page 185.

Note that if the mission had **4 or more
signals** initially (see sidebar, page 208), you
must have investigated **at least 2** before Evac.
Failure to do so means your **Objective total** is
**reduced by 1**.

You may attempt to Evac before 2 signals
have been investigated, but fewer XP will
be awarded.

We’re leaving!
From Round 5 onwards, you can request
**Evac**. Usually this is done once the mission is
completed, but if things go haywire, you may
have to get out of there.

Select which character is making the
request. They must be stationary, cannot be
_Stunned_ , and cannot fire a weapon or take
another action.

Roll **2D6** , adding the number of Objectives
that you have completed so far, including any
packages you are holding. If the requesting
character has **Savvy +1 or greater** , they are
able to talk sense into high command: Add
**+1** to the roll.

_- On a total of_ **_10+_** _, Evac arrives at the end of_
    _the next battle round.
- On a roll of_ **9 or less** _, you must roll again at_
    _the end of each battle round until the drop_
    _ship arrives._

```
At the end of the round after that in which
the successful roll was made, place a marker
anywhere you choose. Any trooper within 3”
of this marker (or moving within 3” of the
marker while the drop ship remains) may be
safely removed from the table.
As the landing zone is extremely dangerous,
Unity drop ship pilots do not loiter excessively
in a combat area. If 3 rounds pass, the ship
leaves and you must make another call.
```
```
They are coming!
The enemy can detect the blast of drop ship
engines. Each time a drop ship arrives, the
Priority is increased by +1 for the remainder
of the mission (see page 187).
```
```
Supporting fire
During each round of hovering including the
arrival round, the drop ship will fire in support
of your squad. It has two Light Machine Guns,
and measures its range and Line of Sight from
the center of the drop ship marker. Resolve
all shots with +1 Combat Skill. Drop ship
weapons cannot malfunction.
```
```
Pay the piper
If you failed to complete any Objectives at
all, you may face a court martial. Select the
character that was in charge of the mission,
and roll a D6. On a 1 , they have been
found guilty: Immediately remove them
from the campaign.
If you have them, you may pay 3 Reputation
points to call in a favor and avoid this fate.
```
## Battle Round


```
After the mission is over, your troopers kick
back for a few well-deserved cold beers while
you fill out the reports. After all, the survivors
may have learned a few new tricks!
```
## Post-Battle Sequence

1. **_Determine Casualties and Lost Marines_**
2. **_Update Completed Missions_**
3. **_Check for Mustering Out_**

9. **_Ready for Another Campaign Turn_**

```
This chapter will go through each step
in the order they are accomplished each
campaign turn.
```
```
Step 1. Determine Casualties and Lost Marines
For each character who became a casualty
during this campaign turn, roll D100 on the
table below, using the Casualty column to
determine their injury. If a character exited the
table via a battlefield edge, rather than through
Evac, use the Lost Marine column instead. If a
main character leaves the campaign because of
injuries or any other reason, a new character is
rolled up and arrives as a replacement.
```

# POST-BATTLE

## Post-Battle


You may spend a point of **Reputation** to
obtain advanced care, reducing **Sick Bay** time
by **1 campaign turn**. This can be done only
once per character per campaign turn.

Step 2. Update Completed Missions
Each character has a **Completed Missions**
tally indicating the number of missions they
have undertaken. Completed Missions affects
eligibility for certain training programs and
affects whether your character **Musters Out**.

Update this number by **1** if the character took
the field. Characters in Sick Bay do not update
their tally.

Step 3. Check for Mustering Out
For any character that increased their
Completed Missions number, a check is
made to see if they decide they’ve had their
fill of bug hunting, and muster out to a new
life. Consult the table below and roll **2D6**. If
you roll equal or above the Muster number,
the character decides to leave the campaign
and is removed from your roster.

```
COMPLETED
MISSIONS MUSTER OUT (2D6)
1-4 No chance
```
```
5-7
```
```
9+ if the character was a
casualty or a lost marine.
No chance otherwise.
8-9 9+
10-11 8+
12 7+
13 6+
14 5+
15 Automatic
```
```
Step 4. Determine Reputation
Reputation can make a difference to your
military career, opening all manner of doors.
You track Reputation in the campaign as an
expendable resource, which can be used to
obtain various advantages and benefits.
If you completed at least 2 Objectives in
the last mission, you receive 1 point of
Reputation automatically. Additionally,
roll 1D6 for every Objective you completed
(including the first 2). Every result of 5 or 6
grants you a further +1 to Reputation.
Reputation is tracked by your group of
characters as a single pool. When points are
expended, they are removed. In reality, your
Reputation does not diminish as such, but as
you call in favors, you reach a limit of what
people are willing to let you get away with.
```
## Oh man... and I was getting short!

```
Troopers in Sick Bay cannot accompany your
squad on missions, meaning your squad will
go into the next battle short-handed. You may
opt to retire an injured trooper if you like. If
so, they are removed from your roster.
Dead, removed, and retired troopers are
replaced at this stage. Roll up a replacement
character normally.
```
## Post-Battle


```
Step 5. Experience and Leveling
Characters that participate in a battle are
awarded Experience Points ( XP ).
```
```
Became a casualty or lost marine +1
Character was removed from play by a method
other than Evac.
Not a casualty, 0-1 Objectives +2
Character Evac’ed and the team completed 0 or
1 Objectives.
Not a casualty, 2+ Objectives +3
Character Evac’ed and the team completed 2 or
more Objectives.
Mission Priority was 4+ +1
Additional reward to all characters.
MVP +1
Awarded to one character of choice.
```
```
Track the accumulated Experience Points for
each character.
Experience Points earned can be cashed in to
obtain an advance, based on the table below:
```
```
ABILITY
SCORE
```
```
XP
COST
```
```
MAXIMUM
PROFILE
Reactions 8 4
Speed 6 8”
Combat Skill 8 3
Toughness 8 5

## Post-Battle


Step 6. Roll for Operational Progress
Mostly, the war is far too big for one platoon
to do anything about. Occasionally, however,
your progress might affect how things
are going, which in turn influenced your
tabletop battles.

```
Roll D100 once on the Operational Progress
table below to determine how the overall
campaign is affecting the war, and vice versa.
All results from this table are cumulative until
this particular operation is over.
```
```

```
```
56-75 Gaining ground
If you achieved at least 2 Objectives last mission, adjust
future rolls on this table by +5.
```
```
76-80 Vital operation
```
```
Pick a random main character that participated in the
last mission. Award them +1 XP for each Objective you
completed, as it was vital to the war effort.
```
```
81-90 Break through
```
```
You’ve pushed the enemy back in critical sectors.
Adjust future rolls on this table by +5.
```
```
91-100 Crippling blow

```
```

```
```
You’ve won! The planet is secure and free of enemy scum.
Gain +1 Reputation and take R&R.
Reset all modifiers to this table.
```
## Post-Battle


```
Step 7. Roll for Military Life
Pick a random main character using any
appropriate method (including characters in
```
```
Sick Bay), then roll once on the Military Life
table below to see what is going on in the
barracks.
```
```
D100 MILITARY LIFE
```
```
1-5
You got in a fight. Roll 1D6+Combat Skill. On a roll below a 5 , spend next campaign turn in
Sick Bay.
6-10 You did a task for an officer. Adjust Reputation by +1 point.
11-15 You have a friend in the Intel Corps. Modify Priority of next mission by +/- 1.
16-20 You spend time in the Brig. Adjust Reputation by -1 point and miss the next mission.
21-25 You’re feeling unmotivated. Lose 2 unspent XP.
26-30 Time tinkering. Select a personal weapon and increase range by +1”.
31-35 Time flies when you’re... just playing cards in barracks.
36-40 You received a recommendation. Next Special Assignments roll is at +2.
41-45 You received a repriman. You cannot take a Special Assignment next campaign turn.
```
```
46-50
Feeling pretty fit. Reduce Sick Bay time by 1 campaign turn. If you didn’t need Sick Bay,
add +1 XP.
51-55 Evening classes: Earn +1 XP.
56-60 You got sick. Spend next campaign turn in Sick Bay.
```
```
61-65
You’re detached on special duties. You cannot participate in the next mission, but you receive a
bonus roll on the Special Assignments table.
66-70 You’re getting in shape, at least. You may immediately raise Speed by +1 for a cost of 5 XP.
71-75 You spend time on the range. You may immediately raise Combat Skill by +1 for a cost of 5 XP.
76-80 You made a friend. Hurray!
81-85 A Dear John letter. Ouch!
```
```
86-90
You cash in a favor. Spend 0-2 Reputation , and for each point you earn 2 XP or a +1 bonus
when rolling for a Special Assignment.
91-95 You did something stupid. Lose 1 Reputation.
96-00 You’re being noticed by the brass. Gain 1 Reputation.
```
```
Step 8. Check Entitlement to R&R
If you have undertaken 4 missions in the
current operation, your crew is entitled to a
bit of R&R : Cross off one extra campaign turn
in Sick Bay for all characters and make an
additional roll on the Military Life table.
Once R&R has been taken, you must play out
another 4 missions before you are entitled to
R&R again. You can pay 1 Reputation point
```
```
to take R&R whenever you please (by being
assigned to light duties back at headquarters).
```
```
Step 9. Ready for Another Campaign Turn
With all eight Post-battle steps completed, you
are ready to take on a new campaign turn and
mission. Good luck!
```
## Post-Battle


**Problem Solving**

**_Bug Hunt_** is a very easy game to create
scenarios for, especially if one player takes the
role of GM. Adding extra or unique objectives
and tasks that need to be accomplished is a
great way to do this: Security doors that need
to be bypassed; computers that need to be
hacked to bring the sentry guns online; or
frightened survivors that need calming.

This section offers a simple sub-system to
handle situational tests as they arise, so
pick whichever fits your situation best. The
mechanics can be combined as needed. This
section is completely optional, will not come
up in typical play, and is intended for creative
players to toy with.

Note that performing a test typically prevents
the figure from attacking that round.

## Quick tests

Suitable when you just need a quick roll to
decide something, or when the action isn’t
heavily dependent on training.

Determine if the test is _Easy_ or _Hard_ , then
roll a **D6**.

An _Easy_ test is passed on a roll of **3+** , while a
_Hard_ test is passed on a roll of **5+**.

## Opposed tests

Suitable when an action is being resisted by
another person, or even by a system (such as
an AI resisting a hacking attempt).

```
Roll a D6 for each figure with the higher roll
prevailing. On a draw, the action is unresolved
this round.
If either character would have a notable
advantage in the content, add +1 to their roll.
```
## Wits tests

```
Suitable when a problem requires training
and expertise to solve.
Set a Challenge Rating from 2 to 7.
Roll 1D6+Savvy for the character.
If the result is equal to or better , the test is
passed.
```
## Modifiers

```
The GM may opt to apply any of the modifiers
below if it suits the situation:
```
_- If a task is_ **Risky** _, rolling a_ **_1_** _on the die_
    _(before modifiers)_ **_Stuns_** _the character.
- If a task is_ **Dangerous** _, rolling a_ **1** _inflicts a_
    **Damage 0** _Hit as well as a_ **_Stun_**_.
- If a task is_ **One Shot** _, the troopers only get_
    _one attempt at accomplishing it. A failed_
    _roll means the task is impossible. Be careful_
    _using this in scenarios.
- If a task is_ Complicated _, only a trooper_
    _with appropriate training or equipment can_
    _attempt it. The scenario should specify who_
    _has the appropriate qualifications._

# APPENDICES

## Appendices


**Signals (Optional rule)**

```
As the drop-ships land, your comms officer
picked up a host of activity throughout the
battle area. Much of it has fallen silent now,
but it may be worth exploring. With the battle
area scanned before the drop, a number of
hot spots have been identified – survivors or
surviving troopers from a prior mission. Of
course, they could also be ambushes...
Signals add detail, but mean more things to
check and remember, so are included as an
optional. Decide before a mission if you want
to use the Signals rule, and it does not have to
be used in every mission of a campaign.
```
```
Increased Alertness
Signals represent areas the enemies are almost
certainly aware of, and which are more likely to
be patrolled. Signals will have to be marked on
the table with a token or other marker.
At the end of each round, roll 1D6 for every
Signal that is within 9” of a trooper (regardless
of Line of Sight or terrain). For every 1 on a die,
place a Contact marker on top of the Signal
marker. Once placed, the Contact marker will
move normally in future Enemy Action phases.
```
```
Investigating a Signal
To investigate a Signal, a figure must finish a
move within 3” of the marker without firing
a weapon or engaging in a Brawl (the same
conditions as for Tactical Locations ).
As enemies will trap, bind, and secure any
personnel, they ignore Signals when moving,
and do not interact with them in any fashion.
```
```
Resolution
When a Signal is investigated, roll D6 on the
table below to reveal its source. Position any
figure placements indicated under “Effects” on
or within 1” of the marker, where possible.
```
```
We can’t just leave them, can we?
If only 1-3 Signals are present, HQ considers
the chance of survivors too unlikely: you are
free to pursue or leave Signals as you see fit.
If there 4-6 Signals present, HQ requires you
to search the area. Unless you investigate at
least 2 Signal markers , you must reduce the
number of Objectives completed by
1 point.
```
```
D6
```
```
SIGNAL
SOURCE EFFECTS
```
```
1 Civilians
```
```
You find 1D3 civilians. They have a normal trooper profile, but no weapons. They
cannot act this round. You receive 1 point of Reputation for each civilian you
successfully evacuate with your squad.
```
```
2 Evidence
Someone wanted you to find this. It seems to be data pointing to the origin of the
attack. This counts as 1 additional Objective completed.
```
```
3 Danger
```
```
The signal is a beacon. Upon replaying the message, it warns of an entry point the
enemies are using to attack. Randomly select a point along the battlefield edges
and mark it as Spawn Point (using the rules on page 199).
```
```
4 Ambush Whoever signaled is long dead and this place is hot! Treat the Signal as a Contact
marker that rolled 3-6 , placing enemies normally as per the Contact rules (see p.192).
```
```
5 Trooper
```

**Co-op campaigns**

This chapter provides options for multiple
players to pursue a campaign together,
with each game feeding into a shared
experience. This is perfectly suited for
a gaming club, online communities, or
friends separated by distance.

As you play the campaign, you will fight to
retake a colony, city, or even an entire world,
with each player contributing to the overall
war effort. All campaign and battle rules
apply as normal, except for the following
adjustments.

## Preparatory Steps

```
Enemies
You will need to decide if you want to play
against a single enemy type, or if you want
to roll each time as you normally would.
If you want a theme to the campaign, you
might opt to pick 2-3 enemies from the
Enemy table (see pp.194-5) and randomize
between them each time.
```
```
Difficulty setting
All players should be using the same
difficulty setting.
```
```
The Map
To create the campaign, you will need a
map. This can be as simple or as elaborate
as you like, and can represent a territorial
region, a city map, industrial facility, or
other location of choice.
```
## Appendices


```
The map needs to be divided into sectors.
These can be any shape you like but a grid
map will have a nice military look. The number
of sectors depends on how many players
you have, and how long you would like the
campaign to run: As a guideline, try 3 sectors
per player for a shorter campaign, up to 5 for a
longer campaign.
While the map simply needs to be functional,
the campaign will be far more enjoyable if
each sector has a distinct identity, either in
the terrain present or in what you decide to
name it. Fighting to clear out vent crawlers
inside an old reactor is much more evocative
than “Sector 3”, after all.
For each sector on the map apply the
following steps (which can be done by any
player).
```
_1. Roll_ **_2D6_** _and pick the lower of the dice to_
    _establish a_ **_Priority Rating_** _for the sector._
    _Note that any Vital or Critical Objectives_
    _will increase this as normal (see p.187),_
    _but only for the duration of that specific_
    _mission.
2. Roll_ **_D100_** _on the table below to see which_
    _special factors may apply. Optionally, assign_
    _each sector one of these factors based on_
    _what seems to fit your map best. You must_
    _place one of each factor before you can_
    _duplicate any.
3. If the D100 roll ends in a_ **_5_** _or_ **_0_** _(_ **_25_** _,_ **_40_** _,_ **_85_** _,_
    _etc.), the sector is also home to a resource_
    _stash of_ **_1D6 Support points_**_._

```
D100 FACTOR EFFECTS
01-15 Ambush zone No visibility is possible beyond 8”.
```
```
16-30 Infiltration point
At the end of each operational turn (see below), select a random adjacent
sector and increase the Priority level by +1 (to a maximum of 6 ).
```
```
31-50 Sheltered
The sector cannot be attacked until at least one adjacent sector has been
cleared.
```
```
51-65 Swarming
When revealing any Contact marker, the number of enemies is increased
by +1.
66-80 Obstructed Evac ships cannot provide covering fire.
81-90 Inaccessible Only a single support roll can be made.
```
```
91-00 Hot zone
The evac ship cannot loiter. It will evac any troops in range upon arrival,
and then leave immediately. The ship must be called again, if needed.
```
## The Campaign Turn

```
A co-op campaign progresses in a series of
operational turns. During an operational
turn, each player will carry out a mission,
followed by a roll for Enemy Moves. Note
that the normal Operational Progress table
is not used.
```
```
Operational turns continue until all sectors
have been cleared of enemies and all Lairs
have been destroyed.
```
## Appendices


## The Battles

Each operational turn, the players should agree
on which sector they will each attack during
that round. Each player may attack one sector
of their choice. As the troops are air-mobile, you
may normally attack any sector on the map.

Set up the mission as normal, using the
Priority level from the sector map.

_- If the mission is a victory (_ **_2+ Objectives_**
    _completed), clear the sector from the_
    _map, and claim_ **_1 Support point_** _worth_
    _of resources (in addition to the_ **_+5_** _if a_
    _Resource stash was present).
- If the mission failed, the sector remains_
    _under enemy control._

```
Support Point Resources
All Support point resources uncovered are
added to a common pool which any player
may draw on when undertaking a mission.
Simply add any desired points to the Support
that would normally be available.
Players must devise an agreement on how
points are allocated, whether points remain
with the player that uncovered them, can
be handed over, or are allocated by a GM or
commander in chief.
Points remain until they are used.
```
```
Enemy Moves
At the end of each operational turn, the
enemy will carry out their actions. Each player
rolls on the table and applies the results to
the map. Typically in an online campaign,
one player will manage and update the map
as they get results sent in. If a sector needs
to be selected, pick randomly using any
appropriate die roll or it may be done by a
GM if available.
```
```
D100 ENEMY MOVE EFFECT
01-10 Enemy assault A cleared sector falls to the enemy. Priority level 3.
11-21 Enemy digs in One enemy sector becomes an Ambush zone.
22-30 Enemy establishes control One enemy sector becomes Obstructed.
31-39 Enemy gathers forces One enemy sector becomes an Infiltration point.
```
```
40-47 Enemy sabotage!
During the next operational turn, all battles are fought with
-1 Support point.
```
```
48-56 Enemy patrols
One enemy sector is heavily patrolled: When rolling for Contact
marker actions, add +1 to the Aggression die.
```
```
57-65 Enemy swarms
One enemy sector is swarmed. Place 1 additional Contact
marker at the beginning of the battle.
```
```
66-73 Enemy elites
```
```
One enemy sector is held by elite forces.
```
- If **Combat Skill** is +0, raise it to **+1**.
- If **Toughness** is 3, raise it to **4**.
Raise **Speed by +1”**.
74-85 Wastage Reduce **Support** reserves by **-1D3 points**.
86-00 Suspicious activity One enemy sector increases **Priority** by **+1**.

**Enlisting as a bug hunter**

```
You may decide that your current Five Parsecs
from Home ( 5PFH ) character would like to
try their hand as a Bug Hunter. You may do
this after any mission: Select which characters
would like to enlist and roll 2D6 for each, to
see they can pass the examination test:
Add your Combat Skill to the roll.
Add +1 (max) if you have any Sector
Government Patrons on your contacts list.
If the score is 7+ , the enlistment is accepted
for that character.
If the roll fails, 1 Story Point will get you in
with any suitable explanation.
Note that Credits will not buy entrance: While
Unity administration is quite susceptible
to nepotism and paperwork, bribery is
extremely difficult.
Once enlisted, you are a brand new trooper
with 0 missions to your belt and
Reputation 0 (you may be famous in some
corner of Fringe Space, but you’ll earn your
Rep like any other Bug Hunter !)
```
```
The following notes are applicable:
```
_- All characteristics carry over normally.
- Species abilities carry over, where applicable.
- You can retain a single weapon with the_
    _Pistol trait. All other items must be stashed_
    _until you return to your_ 5PFH _play.
- You cannot carry over “Stars of the Story”_
    _options or_ **_Story Points_** _to_ **Bug Hunt**_. Keep_
    _a record of them, in case you want to return_
    _to_ 5PFH _play.
- While enlisted, all progression follows the_
    _rules in_ **Bug Hunt**_._
Timing can be challenging if you have two
campaigns concurrently. You can resolve this
in any way you like, either by alternating
games between each campaign. or pausing
one campaign whenever you want to play a
while in the other.
If your entire crew is enlisted, your ship and
possessions are guarded by Unity. No interest
will accrue.

```
Mustering out to
Five Parsecs From Home
```
When a character retires or musters out from
their Bug Hunting career, you may wish
to carry them over into **_Five Parsecs from
Home_**. The character may simply be added
as one of your starting crew when beginning
a new campaign, or at any time when a new
character would be available to your campaign
(whether through recruiting or other
campaign events).

The following rules apply:

_- The character retains their profile.
- Any unused XP are retained. Going forward,_
    _the character must spend XP as per the_
    5PFH _rules.
- If the character served in_ **_10+ Completed_**
    **_Missions_** _, they retain their Service Pistol._
    _No other equipment can be retained.
- The Completed Missions number is no_
    _longer relevant and can be erased, though_
    _you may want to keep it as a reminder._
       _- You receive a mustering out benefit of_
          **_1 Credit for every 2 Completed Missions_**_._
       _- Add_ **_1_** **Story Point** _for_ each _character_
          _mustering out._
       _- You may immediately add a_ **_Sector_**
          **_Government Patron_** _to the list of_
          _Patrons known. This Patron does not offer_
          _a job immediately, but is added to the_
          _list of contacts._
       _- Going forward, your character is now a_
          5PFH _character and should follow all_
          _rules in that system. You cannot carry over_
          _any “Movie Magic” options but if you_
          _are starting a new_ 5PFH _campaign, you_
          _receive the normal allotment of “Stars of_
          _the Story” options._

**Galactic Timeline**

The following is a timeline of the Unified
Space setting. Entries are generally from the
perspective of humanity / Unity and all years
are given using familiar Earth time-keeping.

Countless smaller conflicts, incidents, and
discoveries occured in addition to those
listed here.

2051: Advances in theoretical computing
The first, stumbling implementations of non-
linear computing principles spur significant
advances in technology.

2069: Solar system mining projects
Using automated systems and drones,
resource exploitation of the Moon and
several asteroids begins. While the
rewards rarely exceed the considerable
cost, it spurs widespread interest in the
development and exploitation of space and
is accompanied by the construction of long-
term orbital habitats.

2074: Solar system colonization begins
Dramatic increases in propulsion allows the
creation of long-term habitation throughout
the solar system, as well as a renewed program
of interstellar probes with the prospect of
exploring beyond the solar system.

As technology advances, habitats are pushed
further and further out into the outer reaches
of the solar system.

2084: The Cosmos 9 disaster
A catastrophic chain of events leads to the
destruction of the Cosmos 9 far-system habitat
with a loss of all 163 individuals on board.
This gives fuel to a series of anti-deep-space
movements which begin to coalesce into the
Nearest Ground movement, advocating that
exploration beyond the asteroid belt is too
expensive and too dangerous.

```
2086: The Expedition 3 incident
A heavy probe is destroyed after
launch from the Cosmos 7 far-system
habitat, resulting in the habitat being
decommissioned due to extensive damage.
Miraculously, nobody is killed. It is long
suspected that the incident is a result of
intentional sabotage, but no conclusive
evidence is presented. Nearest Ground
activists seize upon the incident.
```
```
ca. 2097-2144: The stagnation
A prolonged period of scientific stagnation
on Earth characterized by risk-averse
policies and general economic malaise.
Commonly attributed to the Nearest Ground
movement gaining global acceptance
results in a near-complete stop to far-space
exploration projects and consequent
technological development. However, the
unravelling of unprofitable solar system
investments and undermining of public
confidence also play a role. As expenditures
grind to a halt, a series of global financial
recessions strike. Old social models struggle
to respond to the challenges.
```
```
ca. 2099-2147: Hegemony Wars
Wide-spread low-intensity conflicts
occur on Earth, as nation-states give way
to regional and corporate alliances of
interest. As resources grow scarcer and
infrastructure more battered, the economic
effects of the stagnation intensifies. By
the end of the period, the nation-state has
effectively been supplanted by doctrinal
power-groups or corporate-backed military
organizations, with the shambling global
economy primarily driven by the war
economy of increasingly independent
corporate states.
By 2143, the hegemonies are exhausted, and
the global community seems poised for a
wide-spread technological collapse.
```
## Appendices


```
2132: Foundation of Sky-Reach project
A secret group of visionaries begin gathering
in an underground complex in the Ural
Mountains. It is comprised of scientists and
mathematicians plucked from all over the
world, funded by a syndicate of far-sighted
moneyed interests. The purpose of the project
is to find a technological path out of the global
malaise, but the focus quickly becomes a
breakthrough in star-travel.
```
```
2144: Sky-Reach probe launched
In secrecy, a high-tech probe is launched by
the Sky-Reach project, seeking confirmation
of mathematical calculations. If the theories
prove correct, faster-than-light travel could be
within reach of mankind in a matter of years.
```
```
2148-ca. 2168: FTL discovery /
Tech Era begins
Weak points in space are discovered – the
first step towards Tunnel technology,
enabling faster-than-light travel along
reliable and predictable principles. The first
proof of concept drive is tested in 2148 with
development rapidly proceeding afterwards.
As new avenues for expansion and profit
becomes viable, the Hegemony Wars come
to a close and the period retroactively titled
the Tech Era begins. This period sees massive
leaps in technological development and
prowess, which in turn kickstarts the ailing
global economy. As the technological progress
seems to provide salvation from mankind’s
decrepit state, the first tech cults begin to
emerge in society.
```
```
2152: 4th Generation AI developed
As technological development expands at
speed, adjacent research also accelerates.
This results in the universal integration
of 4th Generation AI, far beyond the early
algorithmic reproductions of human
productivity or subsequent emulations
of sentient response. While AI tech never
becomes capable of replacing humans in
```
```
every possible pursuit, it grants considerable
advantages in many fields of research, and
lays the groundwork for almost all of the
technology a galactic civilization requires. Tech
cults explode in popularity, with AI systems
taking on mystical associations, some claiming
that the time has come for human concession
to the altruism of a superintelligence. In some
areas, this leads to armed clashes and riots,
before the cults are forced underground in
most corporate-controlled sectors.
```
```
2167: First colonization
The first human colonies intended for
permanent settlement of civilians are
established. Early colonization is dangerous,
with high risk of failure, as many surveyed
worlds turn out to be non-viable. Casualties
are high, and early colonists receive a
reputation for being bitter survivors or foolish
optimists. On worlds with teeming eco-
systems, some colonists abandon the often
oppressive, corporate-controlled colonies and
become Nomads.
```
```
2177-2179: First colonial War
As interests between colonial self-
determination and corporate profit-extraction
intensifies, in 2177 a trio of wealthy colonies
declare themselves an independent
political entity and demand renegotiation
of agreements with the owning mega-
corporations. Initial resistance leads to
open but inconclusive warfare as neither
side can gain an upper hand. Conflict ends
with establishing a model of colonial self-
governance while maintaining economic ties.
This will form the dominant system for the
next 60 years.
The conflict is studied extensively by military
academies as the first practical experience in
galactic warfare.
```
## Appendices


2190: Karlenhertz generator developed
A technological breakthrough eventually
known as the Karlenhertz principle allows the
construction of Weak Point Generators. These
allow faster-than-light travel to be conducted
with increased stability, as a major planetary
system can now be travelled to and from
without having to wait for fluctuations in the
structure of space.

This also allows much faster inter-galactic
communications to be established.

2204: Terraforming technology developed
With the aid of advanced AI systems,
scientific breakthroughs enable large-scale
terraforming. With time, this will enable
planet-wide manipulation of environmental
systems to create breathable atmospheres,
adjusting temperatures and similar factors. By
the present day, even some degree of gravity
adjustment can be done. The costs of these
measures are enormous, requiring exorbitant
amounts of funding to be viable, but this
promises to have profound impacts on human
success among the stars.

```
2211: The Star-Ward Leap begins
Human colonization efforts explode as more
and more worlds are surveyed, terraforming
processes are initiated and colonists begin to
settle. Ultra-corporations spanning multiple
global economies are formed during this
period. Large scale genetic editing begins
during this period and quickly becomes
standard, despite initial moral objections.
```
```
2213: Psionics discovered
The genetic basis for human psionic ability is
conclusively proven. Predictable application
remains elusive, but a range of experiments
are conducted across human space with a
wide range of legality and ethical concern. The
discovery gives rise to a series of post-human
and hyper-evolutionary cult groups.
```
```
2217-2236: Separation Wars
Widespread galactic conflicts erupt
throughout human space, as interests
diverge and independent polities begin to
assert themselves, resulting in a struggle for
domination. These are often referred to as the
Procyon Wars due to the approximate location
of the first battle, as Yellow Confederate ships

```
fire on Earth military patrols. While historians
often describe it as a distinct historical period,
it is ultimately a series of conflicts that are only
tenuously connected.
While the conflicts are ongoing, incessant
Human/K’Erin warfare continues in a series
of localized conflicts that further encroach on
Human-claimed space.
It is during the prolonged space battles of this
era that the first instances of Degenerative
Violence Syndrome (DVS) are recorded.
The isolated colony of Z-229 begins genetic
and psionic experimentation that will
culminate in the emergence of the post-
human type known as The Many.
```
```
2224: First K’Erin contact
A scout ship makes first contact between
human explorers and the alien species known
as the K’Erin. Initial communications show
promise, and the K’Erin withdraw from the
system without further actions. The news
sends shockwaves through human society
as plans must be reevaluated. A number of
different political movements arise advocating
different methods of interacting with this and
an other alien species.
```
```
2224: K’Erin Contact War
Within weeks of K’Erin contact, open warfare
breaks out, plunging mankind into galactic
war for the first time. The conflict is fairly
brief, though damage to fleets and military
infrastructure is extensive. Earth military forces
are revealed to be ill-prepared for warfare
on this scale. The results of the conflict is to
establish K’Erin territorial claims by treaty,
though many of the worlds claimed are of
relatively little value and several were not near
human-controlled space.
K’Erin historians will refer to this conflict as
the “War of Trials”, positioning it as a conflict
they initiated to test the newly encountered
species. The treaty documents include the
designation of humans as a Worthy Foe.

2249: Unity founded
In light of the experiences from the K’Erin
Contact War and the Separation Wars,
Unity is founded to consolidate and defend
human interests across space. The first
member worlds are those with significant
political and economic power, forming the
Core Worlds of today.

2254-2285: The Wayward Wars / Second
Wars of Separation
A new series of conflicts take place, as Unity
extends its reach and brings most human
polities into its sphere through diplomacy,
economic pressure, or outright military action.
While most worlds join voluntarily, many of
the conflicts are particularly fierce and, even
200 years later, what position your family
took at the time can be a point of pride or
embarrassment.

The alien menace known as the Swarm is
encountered during these conflicts. The initial
encounters may have been lost to historical
records, but it is commonly accepted that the
Lukas-9 portal incident in 2257 allowed the
creatures to spread across populated worlds,
preventing any attempts at containment.

2258: First “Many” contact
Unity exploratory fleets regain contact with
Z-229. Through accelerated development,
they have attained a psionic hive-mind and
have become genetically incompatible with
baseline humanity. The Genetic Derivation
laws are passed to grant them Protected status
under Unity law, though they remain an
independent but affiliated political entity.

2259: First Engineer contact
Emissaries from the species known as the
Engineers are encountered, seeking to
establish diplomatic relations with Unity.

2288: First Precursor contact
The aliens known as Precursors initiate
contact with Unity. They present themselves

```
as diplomats warning of an imminent threat
to galactic stability, though the warnings are
frustratingly vague. Large-scale diplomatic,
technological, and economic ties are initiated.
```
```
2290: First Converted incursion
A threat of unknown origin, the cybernetic
species known as the Converted invade known
space with the initial fleets striking Unity and
Precursor territory in particular. Countless
independent human systems are overrun and
absorbed by the invaders. A rapid response by
combined Unity, Precursor, and K’Erin forces
shatters the initial invasion forces in a series
of quick battles, celebrated for establishing a
new doctrine in space battles.
As the invasion fleet command structure
crumbles, the invasion falters and while
smaller-scale operations will continue into
2291, major fighting ceases within 8 months
of the first attack.
```
```
2292-2299: Uplifts and gene-mods standardized
Extensive AI-guided experimentation
with uplifting animals, as well as genetic
modification comes to fruition, producing a
number of viable genetic variants. Stalkers
and Hulkers, as well as most Feral strains
are all created during this time period. 2279
marks the end of wide-spread creation of
post-human species after an activist group
uncovers evidence that technology acquired
from the Converted invaders has been used in
the uplift program.
While continued creation is outlawed, the
period sees massive development in genetic
modifications in record speeds, allowing
unprecedented modifications to be done.
```
```
2298-2301: Precursor-K’Erin dominion war
After both sides declare protectorates over
low-tech local alien populations in border
territory, hostilities erupt into open warfare
between Precursors and K’Erin, while Unity
remains neutral.
```
## Appendices


```
Initial Precursor successes are reversed when
a K’Erin assault targets Precursor core worlds
with biological weapons. The war is brought
to a conclusion after Precursor forces threaten
solar detonation in a contested star system.
```
```
2305: First Swift contact
The diminutive aliens known as the Swift are
spontaneously discovered across hundreds of
worlds. Population groups are incorporated
into the K’Erin, Precursor, and Unity protective
spheres respectively. The Swift insist that they
have always been here, but until now the
time-diamonds did not line up correctly.
```
```
2306-2309: Second K’Erin-Unity war
Diplomatic missteps result in open warfare
with the K’Erin. Due to relative military
parity, results are inconclusive. As the conflict
threatens to spill over into Precursor space,
a ceasefire is reached. In 2309, border
restoration and global-level ordnance
limitation treaties are signed between all
three parties.
```
```
2329-2352: Renegade wars
A period characterized by widespread low-
intensity warfare among worlds furthest from
Unity control. Many of these conflicts are
purely local affairs but frequently spill over,
and result in sector-wide conflict. While the
major powers often interfere, the results are
modest. Most historians point to this as the
creation of the uncontrolled region of space
known as the Fringe.
```
```
2370: First Manipulator contact
Precursor diplomats facilitate first contact
between Unity and the species that will come
to be known as the Manipulators. Large-scale
commercial treaties are signed, allowing for
high-tech imports, though Unity diplomats
largely sidestep Manipulator concerns about
Unity military bases and colonies near their
region of space.
```
```
2373-2374: Uplift rebellions
A series of violent rebellions break out at
Uplift-populated colonies near Manipulator
space. The Manipulators offer to provide peace-
keeping forces in return for treaty concessions.
Due to a series of space anomalies, Unity
is hard-pressed to concentrate military
forces, though the rebellions are eventually
suppressed with K’Erin aid.
The ensuing treaties grant semi-autonomous
status to several colonies, relocating the 6th
Unity Strike Fleet base away from the region,
and grants official recognition of the Feral
genetic subtype as an independent, human-
derived species.
```
```
2357-2369: 2nd Converted War
Converted invasion fleets strike across the
galaxy, seemingly from an array of staging
points previously undetected. While all
sentient species come under attack, Precursor
space is hit particularly hard.
The tide begins to turn in 2362 with the
establishment of multi-species strike forces
and, by 2369, the invasion is considered at an
end, though scattered fighting continues for
decades to come.
```
```
2367: First core signals detected
Strange transmissions of alien origin are
detected, emanating from the galactic core.
The regions of origin are widely suspected
to be inaccessible through conventional
interstellar travel. The Precursors and Swift
both warn against investigation for reasons
unrelated to the ongoing conflict, but the
Precursors refuse to elaborate and the
information gained by the Swift is cryptic and
convoluted, even by their standards.
A K’Erin scout fleet is dispatched, but
disappears without trace.
The signals last for 40 Earth-days before
receding, but transmit thereafter at 22-year
intervals.
```
## Appendices


2368: Joint Defense worlds established
As the Converted War winds down, the
Precursors and Unity create a series of Joint
Defense worlds along their regional borders.
These will feature troops and ships from both
sides which are, by treaty, forbidden to be
employed off-world.

2372: First Soulless contact
The robotic species known as the Soulless are
encountered along the galactic edge. Initial
contacts are generally friendly, and cooperation
quickly ensues. The Soulless pledge
contribution to matters of galactic peace and
quickly integrate into economic networks in
return for a limited array of settlements.

2372-2374: K’Erin War of Steel Honor
The K’Erin pose a series of demands to the
Soulless, intending to provoke a conflict.
After 3 months of negotiations, the Soulless
break off all communications and mount an
expeditionary force into K’Erin space. The
ensuing conflict is primarily fought in space
and on orbital stations, and is occasionally
referred to as the Void War.

```
The conflict is inconclusive, with both sides
primarily striking at military assets, and a
mutual ceasefire is agreed upon when new
Converted threats emerge.
```
```
2374-2380: 3rd Converted war
A contested world from the 2nd Converted
War is revealed as a major production site and
staging ground. Within months, the entire
sector is aflame, and forces are rushed in
to contain the attack. Seventeen populated
worlds within the sector are lost before the
allied forces gain supremacy. Most of the
sector remains under Unity fleet interdiction
to the present day.
```
```
2383: First Skulker contact
The Skulkers approach Unity and K’Erin
space, requesting diplomatic recognition
and formal ties. Historians point out that
trade with the Skulker worlds had been
ongoing for some time, but the species had
remained relatively aloof and isolated. A
change in public policy leads to the Great
Exodus, as the Skulkers spread across
known space, quickly integrating into Unity
```
## Appendices


```
and K’Erin societies, while their home
worlds remain largely independent from
galactic affairs.
```
```
2386: First reports of Abductors
Multiple Unity worlds report attacks from
unidentified ships, later determined to be
from a minor alien species in unexplored
galactic space. The species, nicknamed
Abductors, is hesitant to engage in diplomacy
but warns of a coming galactic horror that
they are hoping to contain. Requests for entire
galactic population to submit to the Abductor
psionic hierarchy are not successful.
```
```
2390-2400: Cybernetic war /
4th Converted War
A new Converted assault begins from within
K’Erin space but quickly spills across sector
boundaries. Initial counterattacks in 2391
are disrupted, as stray weapons fire causes
planetary destruction in the K-204 system.
The debris causes widespread devastation
to both fleets and severely cripples K’Erin
fleet resources.
The Soulless commit immediately and
dispatch major forces. These will form the
core of the military resources for the rest of
the conflict while Unity provides supplies and
military hardware.
The incursion is deemed contained by 2400,
as a number of lost colonies are bombarded
from orbit to destroy Converted production
facilities. Permanent interdiction is set up
with combined K’Erin/Soulless scout bases
positioned in the remains.
```
```
2403: First Horde contact
A trio of worlds abandoned during the
Wayward Wars sees an array of portals open.
As scout ships move to investigate, they come
under immediate fire. The newcomers use a
technological paradigm unlike any used by
known cultures, and refuse all attempts at
communication. They will later be nicknamed
“The Horde” by Unity troops.
```
```
2403-2454: Horde Dominion War
As Horde vessels continue to emerge, open
war breaks out. The ensuing conflict becomes
one of the largest military actions in galactic
history, involving most species. Unity bears
the brunt of the fighting, but expeditionary
forces are provided by all polities. Some
of the most enthusiastic fighting is carried
out by Skulker detachments eager to gain
additional recognition and privileges under
Unity government.
Historians sometimes sub-divide the Horde
Dominion War into distinct conflicts, but
fighting never completely ceases. The
Horde arrives in waves from the portals in
seemingly-inexhaustible waves of military
forces. A series of desperate targeted strikes
destroy two of the portal facilities, in 2449
and 2451 respectively.
With the Horde switching to the defensive,
several assaults on the final portal world fail.
Eventually the Skyburn Conclave is signed
between the Precursors, K’Erin, and Unity,
authorizing the use of global-level ordnance
for the purpose of ending the conflict.
In 2454, the final portal world is destroyed,
ending the invasion and marking the formal
end point. Mopping up operations continue
for many years.
```
```
2461-2465: Reclamation war
A series of efforts are launched individually
by major powers to retake previously
Converted-held worlds. The campaigns lack
coordination and produce limited results
despite fierce fighting.
```
```
2467: First Hakshan contact
Hakshan emissaries arrive on the galactic scene
and begin integration into galactic affairs.
```
```
2468: Now
You are here.

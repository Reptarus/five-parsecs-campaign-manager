# Battlefield Generator Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Five Parsecs battlefield generation system based on core rulebook specifications (core_rules.md lines 8527-8570).

## Core Requirements

### 1. Battlefield Configuration
- Support for multiple battlefield sizes (2x2, 2.5x2.5, 3x3 feet)
- Digital scale conversion (2 units = 1 inch)
- Configurable dimensions for special missions
- Support for different environment types (urban, wilderness, space station, ship interior)

### 2. Feature Categories
1. Large Features (10 per standard battlefield)
   - Buildings/structures (25%)
   - Rock formations (20%)
   - Forest/vegetation clusters (15%)
   - Cargo/container areas (20%)
   - Industrial equipment (20%)

2. Small Features (5-10 per battlefield)
   - Individual rocks
   - Small crates
   - Single trees
   - Barriers
   - Debris

### 3. Placement Rules
- Minimum spacing between major features (6" equivalent)
- Edge clearance requirements (3" from edges)
- Line of sight considerations
- Path accessibility requirements
- Maximum density per sector

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Generation (30 hours)
1. Grid System (8h)
   - Configurable grid size
   - Cell type management
   - Coordinate system
   - Serialization/deserialization

2. Feature System (12h)
   - Feature type definitions
   - Size calculations
   - Placement validation
   - Feature distribution

3. Environment System (10h)
   - Environment type definitions
   - Terrain type mapping
   - Environment-specific rules
   - Feature compatibility

### Phase 2: Placement Logic (25 hours)
1. Major Feature Placement (10h)
   - Distribution algorithm
   - Spacing validation
   - Line of sight checks
   - Path verification

2. Minor Feature Placement (8h)
   - Gap filling logic
   - Cover point optimization
   - Density management
   - Accessibility checks

3. Deployment Zones (7h)
   - Zone size calculations
   - Valid position checking
   - Balance verification
   - Special mission rules

### Phase 3: Integration (20 hours)
1. Mission System Integration (8h)
   - Mission type support
   - Special objectives
   - Environmental conditions
   - Deployment variations

2. UI Components (12h)
   - Battlefield preview
   - Generation controls
   - Manual adjustments
   - Debug visualization

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (15 hours)
1. Unit Testing (6h)
   - Generation consistency
   - Rule compliance
   - Edge cases
   - Performance benchmarks

2. Integration Testing (5h)
   - Mission compatibility
   - Save/load functionality
   - UI interaction
   - State management

3. Documentation & Polish (4h)
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes

## Success Criteria
1. Generates valid battlefields matching core rules
2. Maintains 60 FPS during generation
3. Supports all mission types
4. 100% test coverage for core systems
5. Documented API for mission system integration

## Dependencies
- TerrainManager (existing)
- FeaturePlacer (to be implemented)
- PathFinder (existing)
- MissionManager (existing)

## Future Enhancements
1. Custom battlefield templates
2. Advanced environmental effects
3. Dynamic battlefield modification
4. Multi-level terrain support
5. Custom rule support

## Next Steps
1. Complete phase processing implementations
2. Finish battle system core mechanics
3. Implement resource management system
4. Create mission generation system
5. Expand test coverage
6. Begin UI polish phase

## Known Issues
1. Phase transitions need proper error handling
2. Battle system needs performance optimization
3. Resource management needs validation
4. UI needs responsive design implementation
5. Save system needs versioning support
6. Test coverage needs expansion
7. Linter errors need resolution

## Notes
- Focus on completing core functionality before adding features
- Maintain modular design for future expansions
- Prioritize stability over feature completeness
- Keep documentation updated with changes
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Follow GDScript best practices

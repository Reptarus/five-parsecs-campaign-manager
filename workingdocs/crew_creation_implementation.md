### 2. Character Generation
1. Basic Attributes
   - Combat Skill
   - Reactions
   - Toughness
   - Speed
   - Savvy

2. Background Generation
   - Species selection
   - Background determination
   - Motivation generation
   - Class selection
   - Special abilities

3. Equipment System
   - Starting gear allocation
   - Weapon restrictions
   - Armor limitations
   - Special equipment rules
   - Ship equipment

### 3. Validation Rules
- Crew size limits
- Resource allocation limits
- Equipment restrictions
- Class/species compatibility
- Starting balance requirements

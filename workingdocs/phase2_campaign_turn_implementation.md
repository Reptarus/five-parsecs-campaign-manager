## Next Steps
1. Complete mission generation system
2. Implement market mechanics
3. Finish resource management UI
4. Add event processing system
5. Expand test coverage
6. Begin campaign flow testing

## Known Issues
1. Mission generation needs balancing
2. Resource calculations need optimization
3. UI needs responsive design
4. Event system needs expansion
5. Save system needs versioning
6. Test coverage needs improvement
7. Performance optimization needed

## Notes
- Focus on core gameplay loop
- Maintain balance in resource economy
- Keep UI intuitive and responsive
- Document all systems thoroughly
- Plan for future expansions
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Follow GDScript best practices
